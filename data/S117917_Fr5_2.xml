      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing thus farre trauelled in the protract, and description of this famous <hi>Empire</hi> of <hi>GREAT BRITAINE,</hi> I might here haue rested, and claimed the priuiledge that yeeres and imbecillitie haue brought me vnto: had not a further desire in others vrged it a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter incident, historically to lay downe the originals of those <hi>Nations</hi> and successions of those <hi>Monarchs,</hi> which either by birth or conquest haue aspired to the <hi>Jmperiall Crowne.</hi> And albeit I finde my selfe both tired in the former, and most vnfit to prosecute this latter, yet will I endeuour to giue herein my best assayes; though as my labours, so my wants also, thereby will be made more vulgar to the world.</p>
   <p>
      <note place="margin">Heraclite.</note> For if those men were blame-worthy against whom <hi>Heraclite</hi> exclaimeth, who <hi>with long toile and great trouble finde a little pure substance in a great deale of base earth:</hi> how shall I then free me from the like imputation, that from so many <hi>mines</hi> of pure <hi>met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</hi> haue gotten so little <hi>Oare,</hi> and the same neither well tried in my defectiue <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,</hi> nor yet artificially cast off through the default of the <hi>mould,</hi> wanting both skil for to fashion, and measure to performe, the true proportions that in such a <hi>proiect</hi> is to be required; and how often <hi>these</hi> my <hi>defects</hi> haue disswaded my proceedings, is best knowne to him that is the <hi>searcher of the heart.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But by what <hi>fate</hi> I am inforced still to goe forward, I know not, vnlesse it be the ardent affection and loue to my <hi>natiue Countrey;</hi> wherein I must confesse that <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> in those <hi>gifts</hi> hath bene both liberall, yea and prodigall, though <hi>Fortune</hi> as spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring &amp; fast-handed against me, euer checking the <hi>Bit</hi> with the <hi>Raines</hi> of necessity, and curbing the <hi>meanes</hi> that should illustrate my labours: which moues me some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to thinke that if the great Philosopher <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> had cause on his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed <note place="margin">Theophrastus.</note>to accuse <hi>Nature, for giuing man so long a lesson, and so short a life;</hi> then I against <hi>Fortune</hi> may as iustly exclaime, that hath assigned me so great a <hi>labour</hi> and so little <hi>meanes.</hi> And therefore let it not seeme offensiue that I draw my <hi>waters</hi> from the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterns</hi> of others, who am not able to fetch them at the <hi>spring-head</hi> my selfe: Neither that I strike vpon the same <hi>Anuile</hi> vnto their <hi>sound,</hi> though nothing so loud, nor with the like strength; wherein yet this <hi>fruit</hi> at least wil (I hope) redound of my <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours</hi>
      <pb n="152" facs="155"/>
that I shall incite <hi>the more learned:</hi> if not otherwise, yet in emulation of me, to free the <hi>face</hi> drawne by <hi>Apelles,</hi> from the <hi>censure</hi> of the fault or defect in the <hi>foot,</hi> and not onely to amend, but euen to new-mould the whole. Which thing though my <note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 35.</note>dayes are neere spent; and with <hi>Barzillai</hi> I may say that <hi>musicke to me is now vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing:</hi>
      <note place="margin">Socrates.</note>yet doth my <hi>eare</hi> thirst after the set of that <hi>straine,</hi> as <hi>Socrates</hi> thoughts ranne euer on his Booke: who the night before he was to suffer death, was desirous to learne <hi>musicke,</hi> because <hi>he would die learning still something. Moses</hi> when he foresaw the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of his <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> which whilst it stood, was the glory of the <hi>earth,</hi> and a <note place="margin">

      <note place="margin">Thales.</note>
      <hi>should be vtterly forgotten, before the things that were done in Salamina should perish:</hi> And therefore as among the wise answeres of <hi>Thales,</hi> the <hi>Histories</hi> of <hi>Countries</hi> are to be <note place="margin">Cicero.</note>accounted for <hi>principals,</hi> either as <hi>Cicero</hi> calleth them the <hi>Mistres of life, and expositions</hi>
      <note place="margin">Simonides.</note>
      <hi>of Times;</hi> so likewise let vs from the <hi>lyricall Poet Simonides</hi> learne this further, That <hi>he</hi>
      <note place="margin">Cassidore.</note>
      <hi>is perfectly happy which knowes his natiue countrey to be truly glorious.</hi> And as <hi>Cassidore</hi> calls him <hi>a worthy Citizen that seeketh the commodity of his countrey:</hi> So contrariwise he is by <note place="margin">Bale in Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeeres gift.</note>
      <hi>Bale</hi> esteemed but a <hi>fruitles clod of earth, that sucks the sappe of his soile onely to himselfe,</hi> whose memoriall shall perish as the dispersed <hi>smoake</hi> in the <hi>clouds,</hi> though for a time he mount aloft in his swelling pride. This naturall <hi>loue</hi> and true <hi>affection</hi> to our <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Countrey,</hi> we may further learne from the ancient <hi>Patriarks</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, who besides a desire that they had to theirs, continually to liue therein during <note place="margin">

Yea, of the vnreasonable creatures, the <hi>Birds</hi> and <hi>Beasts,</hi> we may learne this loue, that alwayes are willing towards their <hi>home.</hi> And if it happen that <hi>Countreys</hi> grow vnkinde as <hi>Homers</hi> did, that in his old age and blind, suffred him to <note place="margin">

   <p>And although our many <hi>Records</hi> are perished by the <hi>inuasions</hi> of <hi>strangers,</hi> through their couetous <hi>Conquest</hi> of so <hi>faire a Land;</hi> or in the <hi>ciuill dissensions</hi> of <hi>homebred aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers</hi> that haue sought the possession of so <hi>rich a Crowne,</hi> yet <hi>Truth</hi> hath left vs no lesse beholding vnto <hi>her,</hi> then <hi>mightier Nations,</hi> and <hi>them</hi> that would be far more <hi>famous.</hi>

      <hi>writers</hi> themselues haue blamed each <hi>others</hi> of <hi>affectation &amp; falshood,</hi> as in <hi>Josephus</hi> we may see; who affirmeth, That <hi>Hellanicus</hi> dissented from <hi>Acusilaus, Acusilaus</hi> with <hi>Diodorus</hi> correcting <hi>Herodotus; Epherus</hi> accused <hi>Hellanicus</hi> of vntrueths; so did <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeus</hi> reproue <hi>Ephorus</hi> of as much; <hi>Philistus</hi> and <hi>Callias</hi> dissented from <hi>Timaeus</hi> in his History of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Thucydides</hi> accounted a lyar by <hi>some. Caesar</hi> is taxed by <hi>Asi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Pollio</hi> (saith <hi>Suetonius)</hi> to be <hi>partiall</hi> in his <hi>Commentaries;</hi> And <hi>Tacitus</hi> by <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> is blamed for vntruths; <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> is reprehended by <hi>Polybius</hi> for defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiuely writing the <hi>Punicke warres;</hi> and himselfe againe with <hi>Silenus, Timaeus, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus, &amp; Hierom,</hi> as much found fault with by <hi>Dionysius Halicarnassaeus,</hi> for writing the <hi>Romane histories so vnperfectly.</hi> And a man may vse the very same speech against <hi>Dionysius,</hi> saith <hi>Bodine. These things</hi> thus standing, let vs giue leaue to <hi>Antiquitie,</hi> who sometimes <hi>mingleth falshoods with truth, to make the beginnings of Policies seeme more honourable:</hi> And whose <hi>power</hi> is farre scrued into the <hi>worlds</hi> conceit, that with <note place="margin">Hierom. in his Prolog. in Iob.</note>
      <hi>Hierome</hi> we may say, <hi>Antiquity is allowed with such generall applause, that knowne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes many times are pleasing vnto many.</hi> Yet with better regard to reuerend <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi>
      <note place="margin">
         <hi>Iob.</hi> 8. 8.</note>whom <hi>Jobs opposer</hi> wills vs inquire after, and to our owne <hi>relations</hi> in deliuering their <hi>censures,</hi> let this be considered; That <hi>more things are let slippe, then are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in any mans writings,</hi> and yet <hi>more therein written, then any mans life</hi> (though it be long) <hi>will admit him to reade.</hi> Neither let vs be forestalled with any preiudicate <hi>opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the <hi>reporters;</hi> that in somethings may iustly be suspected, or in <hi>affection,</hi> which <note place="margin">Titus Liui. lib. 8.</note>by nature we owe to our <hi>naturall Conntrey;</hi> nor consent (as <hi>Liuie</hi> speaketh) to <hi>stand to the ancientnesse of reports, when it seemeth to take away the certainty of truth.</hi> To keepe a meane betwixt both, my selfe with <hi>Bildad</hi> doe confesse, that I <hi>am but of yesterday, and know nothing,</hi> and therefore wil relate the <hi>originall names</hi> and <hi>Nations</hi> of this famous <hi>Jland,</hi> with the <hi>successions</hi> of her <hi>Monarches</hi> and <hi>Historicall actions,</hi> so farre only as is most approued by the best <hi>Writers,</hi> and will leaue other <hi>clouds</hi> of obscurity to be cleared by the <hi>labours</hi> of a <hi>more learned penne.</hi>
