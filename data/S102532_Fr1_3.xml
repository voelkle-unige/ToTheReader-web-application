   <head>The Praeface to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>I</hi> Will use no Praeface but onely say as <hi>Ruffinus</hi> did to <hi>Laurentius</hi>
      <note n="a" place="margin">Interopa Cyp. habetur pag. <hi>543.</hi>
      </note>, <hi>Mihi quidem ad scribendum animus tam non est cupidus, quam nec Idoneus, scienti non esse absque periculo, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum judiciis ingemum teme &amp; exile committere.</hi> And indeed when I first pend these sermons, I did not intend to put them to the Presse, nor to expose my selfe and them to (that which the World is too full of) censure. But finding some part of it in the delivering of them (as namely for the ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of fathers in <hi>Latine</hi> in my Sermons, &amp;c.) for which I have beene traduced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde my back, and perswaded to my face to leave them, I could therefore doe no lesse (for the justifying of my selfe and the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb facs="5"/>
of others) then commit them to the eye, as I did to the eare, to see whether they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue any Pragmaticall censure. It is a true observation of <hi>Macrobius</hi>
      <note n="b" place="margin">Lib. <hi>6.</hi> Satur</note>, that <hi>Multa ignoramus, quae non laterent, si vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum lectio nobis esse familiaris,</hi> wee are ignorant of many things which would not be hid unto us, if the reading of ancient writers were familiar with us, yet such is the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of some, that nothing can please them except it be plaine and delivered <hi>ex tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore</hi> from mens owne braynes, without any ground or light from any ancient fathers. Though <hi>nullum est jam dictum quod non dictum sit prius</hi>
      <note n="c" place="margin">Terent Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch. prolog.</note>, There is no new thing under the Sunne <note n="d" place="margin">Eccles. 1.9.</note>: yet such is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of these <hi>Athenians</hi> that they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together for novelties, which makes their itching eares to be delighted with new fang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led teachers, which preach the Chymaeraes of their owne braynes, altogether neglecting the fathers of the Church. If Prayers or Sermons be pend, they are presently sleigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the more paynes are taken in them,
<pb facs="5"/>
the lesse acceptance have they with these men. I know no reason he had to teare out the <hi>Athanasian Creed</hi> out of his bible; when it was read in the Church, but onely to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy his owne humour, and as little that our <hi>Novelists</hi> have to except against our Church liturgy, except it bee for that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage: from all blindnes of heart, from pride, vaine glory, and hypocrisy, from envy, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and malice, and all uncharitablenes! Good Lord deliver us: which is a great part of their Religion. And I know lesse reason for any to censure so rashly, as to say, that a pend Sermon never converted soule: for I dare presume to maintaine, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have beene converted by reading, and I thinke it must bee pend before it be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and written before it be read. Wee read in the Gospell <note n="e" place="margin">John. 3.</note>: that Christ turned water into wine, hee might as easily have filled the vessels with wine, as made them to bee filled with water first: but to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy that hee will not fill those empty vessells, that come unfurnished into the pulpit, and
<pb facs="6"/>
looke then for Revelations. But if it were lawfull at other times to preach <hi>quicquid in buccam venerit,</hi> yet is it very unfit for a Lecture in Divinity, for a Lecture doth consist of a mixt auditory, and must have as well meat as milke, that the learned may have strength by the one as the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant have growth by the other. Againe a Lecture (as I conceave) was at the first founded for the explayning of the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall poyntes of Religion, and the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of controversies in the <hi>University,</hi> and so are continued by men of great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and eminence, the publique professors. And in Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes (as I conjecture) Lectures were permitted in <hi>Parochiall</hi> Churches, not commanded or injoyned (for I read of <hi>Parsons, Vicars,</hi> and <hi>Curates</hi> in the booke of common Prayer but not of a Lecturer) neither were they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to this end to draw eare-Christians and lip-professors together to parlee in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of poynts of Divinity which they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not, and of matters of Church
<pb facs="6"/>
discipline that doe not concerne them, but to build the people up in knowledge, and to handle matters of controversy, and then in points of controversy, and explicating of difficult points of Divinity, the fathers are very fit to bee urged.<note place="margin">Ob.</note> But it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne tongue, and the <hi>Apostle</hi> sayth <note n="f" place="margin">1 Cor. 14 24</note>: that edifyes not, and therefore <hi>Latin</hi> is not fit to bee used. I answer,<label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Ans. </seg>
      </label> it edifyes the learned if not interpreted, but if interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it edifyes the Church <note n="g" place="margin">Arct in <hi>1. Cor. 14.</hi>
      </note>, and if it were unlawfull to speake in an unknowne tongue altogether, why should S. <hi>Pauls</hi> practice contradict his precept? for hee writes to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Hebrewes</hi> in <hi>Greeke,</hi> when <hi>Latin</hi> was the language of the one, and <hi>Hebrew</hi> the language of the other.<note place="margin">Ob.</note> But it takes up a great deale of time,<label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Ans. </seg>
      </label> Not so much time as many usually spend in vaine Tautologies, and idle repetitions, which stand like ciphers to fill up empty places in their <hi>Sermons.</hi>
      <note place="margin">Ob.</note> But it would please better without them.<label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Ans. </seg>
      </label> Indeed if a <hi>Lecturer</hi> were to live like the poore and the blind meerely
<pb facs="7"/>
by collection, then happily hee must preach to please his good Masters: or else hee would loose a great part of his living. But <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> are not to be made as some <hi>Commae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> made their Playes. <hi>Populo ut pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerent quas fecissent fabulas</hi>
      <note n="h" place="margin">Terence.</note>, And yet (for ought I know) <hi>Sermons</hi> with <hi>Latin</hi> in them may please as well (and better) as those without it.<note place="margin">Ob.</note> But S. <hi>Austin</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe bids not to hearken what <note n="i" place="margin">Epist. <hi>18.</hi> &amp; contra Petil. lib.</note>
      <hi>Rogatus, Donatus, vincentius, Hylary. Ambrose</hi> sayth,<label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Ans. </seg>
      </label> but what sayth the Lord? But S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines</hi> purpose is not <note n="k" place="margin">
         <hi>Hooker</hi> Eccl. Pol. lib. <hi>2.6, 7.</hi>
      </note> (I thinke) when he bids us not to heare men that we should stop our cares against his owne exhortation, and therefore he cannot meane simply; that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience should be denyed unto men, but either if men speake one thing, and God another, then he, not they is to be obeyed, or if they both speake one thing, then also mans speech is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of hearing, not simply, but in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.<note place="margin">Ob.</note> But Lastly, it may be objected the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of themselves are sufficent for salvation and justification. And therefore there is no
<pb facs="7"/>
use of Fathers in <hi>Sermons.</hi>
      <label type="milestone">
         <seg type="milestoneunit">Ans. </seg>
      </label> It is true that the Scriptures are able to make us wise to salvation: but such is the dulnes of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding that we cannot understand the difficult places of it without an interpretor. I confesse I had rather light my dim Lamp at their lights, and take an interpretation from them; then from many moderne writers, and will alwayes use them, and dispise new <hi>non licensed</hi> Pamphlets, that may breed facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and irregularity in the hearers. So that Fathers are not such a <hi>Bugbeare</hi> but a man may looke on them without frighting, and borrow their golden sentences, as the <hi>Israelites</hi> did borrow from the <hi>Aegiptians</hi> Iewells of Silver, and Iewells of Gold. Which may appeare by example, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and <hi>Scripture.</hi> By example, thus, All the Fathers and (almost) all moderne writers doe it, even they themselves that deny it will use moderne writers, how is <hi>Calvin</hi> urged in defence of usury, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Church government and then why may not we cite the Fathers? By reason thus.
<pb facs="8"/>
If it bee lawfull to read them it is lawfull to cite them <note n="l" place="margin">Doctor <hi>West</hi> faling in his Sermon, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched at <hi>Oxford</hi> Anno. 1582.</note>, and if it be lawfull to read later writers (which I know none that doth deny) then why not them? except they may bee read for their manner of tractation, and not for their matter. By Scripture thus. The <hi>Apostles</hi> and our Saviour too bring sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the <hi>Prophets</hi> in the new <hi>Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which were interpretors of the Law, and why may not wee bring sentences of the fathers which are interpretors of the Gospell? Nay S. <hi>Paul</hi> brings sentences from the Poets: <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>Aratus</hi>
      <note n="m" place="margin">Acts 17.28.</note>: <hi>Menander</hi>
      <note n="n" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.33.</note>: and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pimenides</hi>
      <note n="o" place="margin">Tit. 1.12</note>: so that wee may rob the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Poets of their ornaments <note n="p" place="margin">Aret. loc. eom. de Lect. Ethin.</note>: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate them to Christ, much more may we take sentences from the holy Fathers. Besides there are <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Syriack</hi> words used in the new <hi>Testament</hi> without interpreting; as <hi>Anathema, Maranatha, Hosanna,</hi> and <hi>Cephas,</hi> which might occasion <hi>Optatus Milivitanus</hi> (for ought I know) to thinke <hi>Peter</hi>
      <note n="g" place="margin">Lib <hi>2.</hi> contra. Parme.</note>: to bee the head of the Church hee thinking it to be a <hi>Greeke</hi> word and derived
<pb facs="8"/>
from <gap reason="foreign">
         <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
      </gap> a head when as it is a <hi>Sirack</hi> word and signifyes a stone: but there can bee no danger in any mistake in urging sentences of the Fathers being interpreted. So that though we doe not bring any grounds of faith from them, yet it is lawfull and fitting to urge them. First, for interpretation of hard Texts. Secondly, for illustration. Thirdly, for confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of errors as our Saviour quotes <note n="r" place="margin">Mat 23.</note>: the <hi>Pharisees.</hi> Fourthly, for instances, and. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we may use them comparatively, and bring the sayings and examples of <hi>Heathen</hi> to shame <hi>Christians.</hi> I had thought to have sayd more, but fearing least my porch should be too big for my house, &amp; that this book should be like the City <hi>Minda</hi> with too great gates, I conclude wishing thee and all good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to doe that, that shall tend to the glory of God and the peace of the Church, <hi>Farewell.</hi>
