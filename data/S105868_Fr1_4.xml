   <head>The Praeface to the Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Oncerning the former of these two Bookes (gentle Reader) I have to admonish thee of certain things therunto belonging: and first as touching the Author of it; then as touching the booke it selfe.<note place="margin">
         <hi>Of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</hi>
      </note> Who it is that was the Author of it, I do not know, for that the Author hath not put to his name, but only two letters in the end of his praeface: which two letters I have set down under the title of the booke it selfe. But whosoever it is, that was the Author of it, himselfe doth set down, both the occasion wherupon he wrote it; and what was his intent, and purpose ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. The occasion of it was, that one <hi>Gasper Loart</hi> Doctor of Divinitie, and a Iesuit frier,<note place="margin">
         <hi>By what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion he wrote.</hi>
      </note> had before written a booke of much like argument in the Italian toong: which a countrie-man of ours at Paris in France had about four yeers since translated into English; and had done (as he thought) much good therby. Wherupon the Author heerof minding to have imprinted that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and to have inriched it, both with matter, and method: he found the course that he determined, to have this issu in the end, that he thought not good to imprint again that booke of Doctor <hi>Loarts,</hi> but rather to make another of his own, and to gather in therunto, whatsoever is in that booke, or others such like, to this effect. Which course when he had taken, he thought
<pb facs="6"/>
good to follow this order therin: first to shew, how to resolve our selves to serve God indeed; then, how to begin to do it; and lastly, how to continu unto the end. And so setting in hand with the work, and having fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed the first part, that hath he sent over in the mean season,<note place="margin">
         <hi>His intent and purpose.</hi>
      </note> until he shal be able to finish the rest. His intent and purpose was, as himselfe doth witnes, that his countrie-men might have some one sufficient directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for matters of life, among so many bookes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies: for that those (though otherwise he account them needful) do help but little, he saith, oft times to good life; but rather fil the heads of men with a spirit of contradiction &amp; contention, that for the most part hindereth devotion. Insomuch that he much misliketh, that men commonly spend so much of their time so unprofitably, talking of faith, but not seeking to build theron as they ought to do, and so do but wearie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in vain: making much ado, but getting but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle profit therby; much disquieting our selves and others, and yet obtaining but smal reward. Which complaint of his is just indeed, as the matter is han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled by many. And so having protested his good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning therin, desireth al, though they dissent from him in religion: yet, laieng aside hatred, malice, and wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful contention, to join togither in amendement of life, and in praieng one for another. Which we might have heard in his own words, but that he interlaceth other things withal, that I dare not in conscience and dutie to God commend unto thee.<note place="margin">
         <hi>Of the booke it selfe.</hi>
      </note> Concerning the booke it selfe it seemeth to be most of al gathered out of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Schoole-men (as they are termed) that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the corrupter time of the church, did most of al by that occasion treat of reformation of life; when as others were rather occupied about the controversies, that were most in quaestion among them. And although my selfe have bestowed no great time in them: yet by the little that I have bestowed, I see it to resemble
<pb facs="6"/>
them so much (especially for the invention of it) that as we finde somtimes a readie help in the face of the childe, to gesse at the father; so in this likewise, me think that we have in the booke it selfe, that which may lead us to this conjecture. But my meaning at this time is no more but this, first to shew thee what it was as it is set foorth by the Author himselfe: and then what is done therunto by me, that so I might get it published to al.<note place="margin">
         <hi>In what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it came foorth at the first.</hi>
      </note> As it is set foorth by the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, if we consider the substance of it, surely it was wel woorth the labor (a few points only excepted) and much of it, of good persuasion to godlines of life. But if we consider the form, or maner of it, therin maiest thou finde, that it was needful for me, before hand to admonish thee of these few things. First, that through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole booke the Author hath used, in those scriptures that he alledgeth, the vulgar translation that was before in common use with them: and some special words praecisely, such as before they have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon them to observe, and therin stil to discent from us. The vulgar translation is known wel inough: so that I need to say nothing of it. Those special words that praecisely he useth, are, Our Lord, when it is more agreeable to the text to say, The Lord: iustice, for righteousnes: poenance, for repentance: merit, for good works, or the service of God: and a few others. Then also in divers parts of the booke there were min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in withal, certain opinions and doctrines of their own profession, most of them such as are manifest corruptions, and some of them no more but over-ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous: and certain places alledged out of others, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle appertaining to the matter,<note place="margin">
         <hi>What is don to it since. First in the substance which is approoved.</hi>
      </note> or else more coldly handling the matters propounded, than that wel they could match with the residu that are in the Treatise to that purpose alledged. In this maner came it into my hands: and so it is yet extant among them. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my doings therin, first for the substance of it,
<pb facs="7"/>
bicause it is, much of it, good, I have so far not only conceived liking of it my selfe: but also have done my best indevor, thus to publish it unto al; that so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as wil, may take to themselves the benefit of it. In which kind of argument though many others in these our dais have done very commendably likewise? Yet I do specially commend this unto thee, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that it proceedeth from those, that otherwise are for divers points, the greatest adversaries that we have in the cause of religion. And wheras inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate contention is not only unseemly for the church of God, but also hurtful to the cause of religion, a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial point of wisdome it is, when God hath bestowed any good gift on any of us al, that others should so aesteem therof, as that they make the same a mean to moderate the bitternes of their affections towards al those, that gladly would live peaceably with al, so much as they might: as also on the other side it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cleer, that those that wil not (so far as the cause of religion it selfe doth permit them) may have just occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to be ashamed; and therby to finde out, what kind of spirit it is that doth lead them. So the substance of the booke is such, as that a minde that is wel dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, may with one, and the selfesame labor, gather out of it, both lessons of godlines unto it selfe: and that which may somwhat occasion some better agreement among certain of us; with such of them I mean, as stand more indifferent, and are content to dissent no further from us, than of conscience they think that they ought. The former of which wil yeeld us this fruit, that we shal addresse our selves to do, in som good measure, our service to God: the other, that we shal do it with a quieter conscience,<note place="margin">
         <hi>Then in the form or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it, which is amended.</hi>
      </note> our selves desirous to be at peace withal, so far as conveniently may be obteined. On the other side likewise, bicause I found the maner and form so far foorth out of order as I have declared, therfore did I indevor my selfe to help it a little as
<pb facs="7"/>
need required. But as touching the transsation that they use▪ I have altogither let them alone therwith▪ partly to condescend so far unto them, as to suffer themselves in such case to use what translation they wil, and with good wil to hear them therin; and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for that divers points of the matter were so groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded therupon, that the translation might not be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, unlesse the matter were altered likewise. So far foorth therfore as there was no manifest error taken in withal, I have left it wholy unto them: though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise it might oft times be amended. For which cause also I did the rather omit to meddle with the quotations to alledge the verse of the chapter withal, bicause that in distinguishing of the verses we disagree somtimes: and forbearing to obtrude ours to them, unlesse I thought they would take it in good part; have forborn likewise to use theirs, for that we finde it not so agreeable to the truth it selfe. As for those special words of theirs, that the Author so praecisely useth, I have used my libertie therin: somtimes let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them stand as they are; and somtimes altering them, when they were abused, or otherwise the case did so require. Those other points of their proper o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, wherin we dissent from them, and they (no dowt) from the truth it selfe, I have clean left out; and some of those venturous points besides: togither with certain of those places likewise, which he hath alledged out of others, that did not so much apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the matter that he had in hand; or not so ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually touched the same, as himselfe otherwise hath done. The former of which I therfore left out, for that neither my selfe could allow to leave any such as (to my knowledge) might be any hurt; or else but oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of stumbling to others: neither could I so have gotten it foorth to the use of al, carrieng stil such cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption with it. And this have I done so much the rather, for that most of those things seem rather to be
<pb facs="8"/>
added by some that had the perusing of the booke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it might be allowed among them to come to the print, than by the proper Author therof: they do so little oft times agree with the argument that there he hath in hand, nor with the maner of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it. As for example, in the first part of the booke and third chapter, setting down the end of mans life, which he saith is the service of God, eight or nine times in that chapter is joined withal the gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of heaven: which notwithstanding is not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the maner of the Authors handling of that point, as it may appeer in the whole discourse there, and namely by his place of Zacharie in the beginning of the third, and by his division in the beginning of the fourth chapter, where notwithstanding the gaining of heaven is very odly put in again. The other sort like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise I thought good to leave foorth, for that being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, they might discredit some part of the rest, or else but weaker than the rest, might so let down the affections again which were stirred up before by the other. And truly the spirit in these dais doth proceed a great deal more effectually, both in doctrine and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, than it did in the dais of divers of those that were heer alledged. Wherin, if there shal be any that shal think, either on the one side, that I have put out too much, or on the other, that I have put out too little, neither am I desirous to overrule their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor very careful to maintain mine own, if any shal come with better matter: contenting my selfe only with this, that I have done what seemed to me to be most expedient to the glorie of God, and to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his people heer. And so without any further defence of my doings therin, now (gentle Reader) I send thee over to the booke it selfe: where if thou shalt bestow a little pains (though it be no more, but once with advisement to read it over) I dowt not, but that thou wilt confesse thy labor to be wel bestowed. Which
<pb facs="8"/>
when thou shalt finde, then descending to the Author of it, seeing himselfe desireth to be holpen by thy prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, thou shalt do wel, both to thank God for him for this which is done, and to solicite him with thy prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, on behalfe of him and the rest, that it would please him to give them a further knowledge of the truth in Christ, so far as his wisdome hath thought expedient, to the setting foorth of his own glorie, and to the salvation of those that are his. And God give us al (so many as do appertain to his kingdome) his grace in that measure, that both we may agree togither in the truth of religion, and altogither imploy our selves in his service heer, in peace and quietnes one with another. And so I bid thee hartily farewel. At Bolton-Percy, in the ancientie or liberties of York, the 9. of Iulie. 1584.</p>
