   <head>THE LIFE AND DEATH OF D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
      <hi>DONNE,</hi> LATE DEANE OF S<seg rend="sup">t</seg> PAULS LONDON.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F that great Master of Language and Art, Sir <hi>Henry Wootton,</hi> Provost of Eaton Colledge, (lately deceased) had lived to see the publication of these Sermons, he had presented the world with the Authors life exactly written. It was a Work worthy his undertaking, and he fit to undertake it; betwixt whom and our Author, there was such a friendship con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in their youths, that nothing but death could force the separation. And though their bodies were divided, that learned Knights love followed his friends fame beyond the forgetfull grave, which he testified by intreating me (whom he acquainted with his designe) to inquire of certaine particulars that concerned it: Not doubting but my knowledge of the Author, and love to his memory, would make my diligence usefull. I did prepare them in a readiness to be augmented, and rectified by his powerfull pen; but then death prevented his intentions.</p>
   <p>When I heard that sad newes, and likewise that these Sermons were to be publisht without the Authors life, (which I thought was rare) indignation or griefe (I know not whether) transported me so far, that I re-viewed my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken Collections, and resolved the world should see the best picture of the Author that my artlesse Pensil (guided by the hand of Truth) could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to it.</p>
   <p>If I be demanded, as once <hi>Pompeys</hi> poore Bondman was,<note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> (whilest he was alone on the Sea shore gathering the pieces of an old Boat to burne the body of his dead Master) What art thou that preparest the funeralls of <hi>Pompey</hi> the great? Who I am that so officiously set the Authors memorie on fire? I hope the question hath in it more of wonder then disdaine.</p>
   <p>Wonder indeed the Reader may, that I (who professe my selfe artlesse) should presume with my faint light to shew forth his life, whose very name makes it illustrious; but be this to the disadvantage of the person represented, certaine I am, it is much to the advantage of the beholder; who shall see the Authors picture in a naturall dresse, which ought to beget faith in what is spoken, for he that wants skill to deceive, may safely be trusted.</p>
   <p>And though it may be my fortune to fall under some censures for this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, yet I am pleased in a beliefe I have, that if the Authors glorious
<pb facs="6"/>spirit (which is now in heaven) can have the leasure to look downe, and see his meanest friend in the midst of his officious duty, he will not disdaine my well meaning sacrifice to his memory. For whilst his conversation made me (and many others) happy below, I know his humility and gentleness was eminent: And I have heard Divines say, those vertues that are but sparks on earth, become great and glorious flames in heaven.</p>
   <p>He was borne in LONDON, of good and vertuous Parents; And though his own learning and other multiplied merits, may justly seeme sufficient to dignifie both himselfe and posteritie; yet Reader be pleased to know, that his Father was masculinely and lineally descended from a very ancient Family in Wales, where many of his name now live, that have and deserve great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in that Countrey.</p>
   <p>By his Mother he was descended from the Family of the famous Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas More,</hi> sometimes Lord Chancellor of England; and also from that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and laborious Judge <hi>Rastall,</hi> who left behind him the vast Statutes of the Lawes of this Kingdome, most exactly abridged.</p>
   <p>He had his first breeding in his Fathers house, where a private Tutor had the care of him, till he was nine yeares of age; he was then sent to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitie of Oxford, having at that time a command of the French and Latine Tongues, when others can scarce speak their owne.</p>
   <p>There he remained in Hart Hall, (having for the advancement of his stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, Tutors in severall Sciences to instruct him) till time made him capable, and his learning exprest in many publique Exercises, declared him fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his first Degree in the Schooles, which he forbore by advise from his friends, who being of the Romish perswasion, were conscionably averse to some parts of the Oath, alwayes tendred and taken at those times.</p>
   <p>About the fourteenth yeare of his age, he was transplanted from Oxford to Cambridge, where (that he might receive nourishment from both soiles) he staid till his seventeenth yeare. All which time he was a most laborious Student, often changing his studies, but endeavouring to take no Degree for the reasons formerly mentioned.</p>
   <p>About his seventeenth yeare he was removed to London, and entred into Lincolnes Inne, with an intent to study the Law, where he gave great testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of wit, learning, and improvement in that profession, which never served him for any use, but onely for ornament.</p>
   <p>His Father died before his admission into that Society, and (being a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant) left him his Portion in money (which was 3000. li.) His Mother, and those to whose care he was committed, were watchful to improve his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and to that end appointed him there also Tutors in severall Sciences, as the Mathematicks and others, to attend and instruct him. But with these Arts they were advised to instill certaine particular principles of the Romish Church, of which those Tutors (though secretly) profest themselves to be members.</p>
   <p>They had almost obliged him to their faith, having for their advantage, besides their opportunity, the example of his most deare and pious Parents, which was a powerfull perswasion, and did work upon him, as he profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<pb facs="6"/>in his PREFACE to his <hi>Pseudo-Martyr.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>He was now entred into the nineteenth yeare of his age, and being unresol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in his Religion, (though his youth and strength promised him a long life) yet he thought it necessary to rectifie all scruples which concerned that: And therefore waving the Law, and betrothing himselfe to no art or profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that might justly denominate him, he began to survey the body of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, controverted between the Reformed and Roman Church.<note place="margin">Preface to <hi>Pseudo-Martyr.</hi>
      </note> And <hi>as Gods blessed Spirit did then awaken him to the search, and in that industry did never forsake him,</hi> (they be his owne words) <hi>So he calls the same Spirit to witness to his Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that in that search and disquisition he proceeded with humility and diffidence in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, by the safest way of frequent Prayers, and indifferent affection to both parties.</hi> And indeed, Truth had too much light about her, to be hid from so sharp an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer; and he had too much ingenuity, not to acknowledge he had seen her.</p>
   <p>Being to undertake this search, he beleeved the learned Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to be the best defender of the Roman cause: and therefore undertook the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of his reasons. The cause was waighty, and wilfull delaies had been inexcusable towards God and his own conscience; he therfore proceeded with all moderate haste; And before he entred into the twentieth yeare of his age, did shew the Deane of Gloucester all the Cardinalls Works marked with many waighty Observations under his own hand, which Works were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed by him at his death as a Legacy to a most deare friend.</p>
   <p>About the twentieth yeare of his age, he resolved to travell; And the Earle of Essex going to Cales, and after the Iland voyages, he took the advantage of those opportunities, waited upon his Lordship, and saw the expeditions of those happy and unhappy imployments.</p>
   <p>But he returned not into England, till he had staid a convenient time, first in <hi>Italy,</hi> and then in <hi>Spaine,</hi> where he made many usefull Observations of those Countries, their Lawes, and Government, and returned into England perfect in their Languages.</p>
   <p>Not long after his returne, that exemplary pattern of gravity and wisdome, the Lord <hi>Elsmore,</hi> Lord Keeper of the great Seale, and after Chancellor of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, taking notice of his Learning, Languages, and other abilities, and much affecting both his person and condition, received him to be his chiefe Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, supposing it might be an Introduction to some more waighty imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the State, for which his Lordship often protested he thought him very fit.</p>
   <p>Nor did his Lordship account him so much to be his servant, as to forget hee had beene his friend; and to testifie it, hee used him alwayes with much curtesie, appointing him a place at his owne Table, unto which he esteemed his company and discourse a great ornament.</p>
   <p>He continued that employment with much love and approbation, being daily usefull (and not mercenary) to his friends, for the space of five yeares: In which time, he (I dare not say unfortunately) fell into such a liking, as (with her approbation) increased into a love with a young Gentlewoman, who lived in that Family, Neece to the Lady <hi>Elsmore,</hi> Daughter to Sir <hi>George More,</hi> Chancellor of the Garter, and Lieutenant of the Tower.</p>
   <pb facs="7"/>
   <p>Sir <hi>George</hi> had some immation of their increasing love, and the better to prevent it, did remove his Daughter to his owne house, but too late, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of some faithfull promises interchangeably past, and inviolably to be kept between them.</p>
   <p>Their love (a passion, which of all other Mankind is least able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and wherein most errors are committed) was in them so powerfull, that they resolved, and did marry without the approbation of those friends that might justly claime an interest in the advising and disposing of them.</p>
   <p>Being married, the newes was (in favour to M. <hi>Donne,</hi> and with his allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) by the Right Honourable <hi>Henry</hi> then Earle of Northumberland, secretly and certainly intimated to Sir <hi>George More,</hi> to whom it was so immeasurably unwelcome, that (as though his passion of anger and inconsideration should exceed theirs of love and error) he ingaged his sister the Lady <hi>Elsmore</hi> to joyn with him to procure her Lord to discharge M. <hi>Donne</hi> the place he held under his Lordship. And although Sir <hi>George</hi> were remembred that Errors might be over-punisht, and therefore was desired to forbeare, till second considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had cleered some scruples, yet he was restlesse untill his suit was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the punishment executed; The Lord Chancellor then (at M. <hi>Donnes</hi> dismission) protesting, he thought him a Secretary fitter for a King then a Subject.</p>
   <p>But this physick of M. <hi>Donnes</hi> dismission was not strong enough to purge out all Sir <hi>George</hi> his choler, who was not satisfied, till M. <hi>Donne,</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pupill in Cambridge that married him, M. <hi>Samuel Brooke,</hi> (who was after D. in D. and Master of Trinity Colledge in that University) and his brother M. <hi>Christopher Brook</hi> of Lincolns Inne, (who gave M. <hi>Donne</hi> his Wife, and witnessed the Mariage) were all committed to severall Prisons.</p>
   <p>M. <hi>Donne</hi> was first inlarged, who neither gave rest to his body, his braine, nor any friend, in whom he might hope to have any interest, untill he had procured the inlargement of his two imprisoned friends.</p>
   <p>He was now at liberty, but his dayes were still cloudie, and being past this trouble, others did still multiply, for his Wife (to her extreame sorrow) was detained from him.<note place="margin">Genes. 29.</note> And though with <hi>Iacob,</hi> he endured not a hard service for her, yet he lost a good one, and was forced to get possession of her by a long suit in Law, which proved very chargeable, and more troublesome.</p>
   <p>It was not long, but that Time and M. <hi>Donnes</hi> behaviour (which when it would intice, had a strange kind of irresistible art) had so dispassioned his Father in Law, That as the world had approved his Daughters choice, so he also could not choose but see a more then ordinary merit in his new Sonne, which melted him into so much remorse, that he secretly laboured his sons restauration into his place, using his owne, and his sisters power, but with no successe; The Lord Chancellor replying, That although he was unfainedly sorry for what he had done, yet it stood not with his credit to discharge and re-admit servants, at the request of passionate Petitioners.</p>
   <p>Within a short time, Sir <hi>George</hi> appeared to be so far reconciled, as to wish their happinesse; (or say so) And being asked for his paternal blessing, did not deny it; but refused to contribute any meanes that might conduce to their livelyhood.</p>
   <pb facs="7"/>
   <p>M. <hi>Donnes</hi> Portion was the greatest part spent in many and chargeable travels, the rest disburst in some few Books, and deare bought experience; he out of all imployment, that might yeeld a support for himselfe and Wife, who had been curiously and plentifully educated; his nature generous, and he accustomed to confer, not to receive curtesies. These and other consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, but chiefly that his deare Wife was to bear a part in his sufferings, surrounded him with many and sad thoughts, and some apparent apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of want.</p>
   <p>But his sorrow was lessened, and his wants prevented by the seasonable curtesies of their noble Kinsman Sir <hi>Francis Wally</hi> of <hi>Pirford,</hi> who intreated them to a co-habitation with him; where they remained with very much freedome to themselves, and equall content to him for many yeares. And as their charge increased, (she had yearly a child) so did his love and bounty.</p>
   <p>With him they continued till his death: a little before which time Sir <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> was so happy as to make a perfect reconciliation betwixt that good man Sir <hi>George More</hi> and his forsaken sonne and daughter, Sir <hi>George</hi> then giving Bond to pay M. <hi>Donne</hi> 800 l. at a certain day as a Portion with his wife, and to pay him for their maintenance 20. l. quarterly, (as the Interest of it) untill the said Portion were paid.</p>
   <p>Most of those yeares that he lived with Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> he studied the Civil and Canon Lawes: In which he acquired such a perfection as was judged to hold some proportion with many, who had made that study the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their whole life.</p>
   <p>Sir <hi>Francis</hi> being dead, and that happy family dissolved, M. <hi>Donne</hi> tooke a house at Micham (neere unto Croydon in Surrey) where his wife and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remained constantly: and for himselfe (having occasions to be often in London) he tooke lodgings neere unto White-hall, where he was frequently visited by men of greatest learning and judgement in this Kingdome; his company being loved, and much desired by many of the Nobility of this Nation, who used him in their counsels of greatest considerations.</p>
   <p>Nor did our owne Nobility onely favour him, but his acquaintance and friendship was usually sought for by most Ambassadors of forraigne Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and by many other strangers, whose learning or employment occasioned their stay in this Kingdome.</p>
   <p>He was much importuned by friends to make his residence in London, which he could not doe, having setled his dear wife and children at Micham, whither he often retired himselfe, and then studied incessantly some Points of Controversie. But at last the perswasion of friends was so powerfull, as to cause the removall of himselfe and family to London; where that honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Gentleman Sir <hi>Robert Drury</hi> assigned him a very convenient house rent-free, next his own in Drury-lane, and was also a daily cherisher of his studies, and such a friend as sympathiz'd with him and his, in their joy and sorrow.</p>
   <p>Divers of the Nobility were watchfull and solicitous to the King for some preferment for him. His Majesty had formerly both knowne, and much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued him, and had given him some hopes of a State employment, being much pleased that M. <hi>Donne</hi> attended him, especially at his meales, where there was
<pb facs="8"/>usually many deep discourses of Learning, and often friendly disputes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion betwixt the King and those Divines whose places required their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on his Majestie: Particularly, the Right Reverend Bishop <hi>Montague,</hi> then Deane of the Chappel, (who was the publisher of the eloquent and learned Works of his Majestie) and the most learned Doctor <hi>Andrewes,</hi> then his Majesties Almoner, and at his death Bishop of Winchester.</p>
   <p>About this time grew many disputes in England, that concerned the Oath of Supremacy and Allegeance, in which the King had appeared and ingaged himselfe by his publique writings now extant. And his Majestie occasionally talking with M. <hi>Donne</hi> concerning many of those Arguments urged by the Romanists, apprehended such a validity and cleerenesse in his answers, that he commanded him to state the Points, and bring his Reasons to him in writing; to which he presently applyed himselfe, and within sixe weeks brought them to his Majestie fairely written under his owne hand, as they be now printed in his <hi>Pseudo-Martyr.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>When the King had read and considered that Book, he perswaded M. <hi>Donne</hi> to enter into the Ministery, to which he appeared (and was) un-inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, apprehending it (such was his mistaking modesty) too weighty for his abilities. But from that time, though many friends mediated with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie to prefer him to some civil employment, (to which his education had apted him) yet the King denied their requests, and (having a discerning spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) replyed, <hi>I know M. Donne is a learned man, an excellent Divine, and will prove a powerfull Preacher.</hi> After that, as he professeth<note n="*" place="margin">In his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, Expost. 8.</note>, the King descended almost to a solicitation of him to enter into sacred Orders, which though he denied not, he deferred for the space of three yeares: All which time he applyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to an incessant study of Textuall Divinity, and attained a greater perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the learned Languages, Greek and Hebrew.</p>
   <p>Forwardnesse and inconsideration could not in him (as in many others) argue an insufficiencie; for he considered long, and had many strifes within himselfe concerning the strictnesse of life, and competencie of learning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in such as enter into sacred Orders: And doubtlesse (considering his owne demerits) did with meek <hi>Moses</hi> humbly aske God, <hi>Who am I?</hi> And if he had consulted with flesh and bloud, he had not put his hand to that holy plough: But God who is able to prevaile, wrastled with him, as the Angel did with <hi>Iacob,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Gen. 32.</note> and marked him for his owne, marked him with a blessing, a blessing of obedience to the motions of his blessed Spirit; And then as he had formerly asked God humbly with <hi>Moses, Who am I?</hi> So now (being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired with the apprehension of Gods mercies) he did ask King <hi>Davids</hi> thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full question, <hi>Lord who am I that thou art so mindfull of me?</hi> So mindfull of me as to lead me for more then forty years through a wildernesse of the many temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and various turnings of a dangerous life? So mindfull as to move the learnedst of Kings to descend to move me to serve at thine Altar? So merciful to me as to move my heart to embrace this holy motion? Thy motions I will embrace, take the cup of salvation, call upon thy Name, and preach thy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell.</p>
   <p>Such strifes as these S. <hi>Augustine</hi> had when S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> indeavoured his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
<pb facs="8"/>to Christianity, with which he confesseth he acquainted his deare friend <hi>Alippius.</hi> Our learned Author (a man fit to write after no meane Copy) did the like; and declaring his intentions to his deare friend D. <hi>King</hi> the then worthy Bishop of London, (who was Chaplaine to the Lord Chancellor in the time of his being his Lordships Secretary) That Reverend Bishop most gladly received the newes, and with all convenient speed ordained him Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con and Priest.</p>
   <p>Now the English Church had gained a second S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> for I think none was so like him before his conversion, none so like S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> after it. And if his youth had the infirmities of the one Father, his age had the excellencies of the other, the learning and holinesse of both.</p>
   <p>Now all his studies (which were occasionally diffused) were concentred in Divinity; Now he had a new calling, new thoughts, new imployment for his wit and eloquence. Now all his earthly affections were changed into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love, and all the faculties of his soule were ingaged in the conversion of others, in preaching glad tidings, remission to repenting sinners, and peace to each troubled soule: To this he applyed himselfe with all care and diligence; and such a change was wrought in him,<note place="margin">Psal. 84.</note> that he was <hi>gladder to be a doore-keeper in the house of God, then to enjoy any temporall employment.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Presently after he entred into his holy Profession, the King made him his Chaplaine in Ordinary, and gave him other incouragements, promising to take a particular care of him.</p>
   <p>And though his long familiarity with persons of greatest quality was such as might have given some men boldnesse enough to have preached to any eminent Auditory; yet his modesty was such, that he could not be perswaded to it, but went usually to preach in some private Churches, in Villages neere London, till his Majestie appointed him a day to preach to him. And though his Majestie and others expected much from him, yet he was so happy (which few are) as to satisfie and exceed their expectations: preaching the Word so, as shewed he was possest with those joyes that he laboured to distill into others: A Preacher in earnest, weeping sometimes for his Auditory, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with them, alwayes preaching to himselfe, like an Angel from a cloud, though in none: carrying some (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> was) to heaven, in holy raptures; enticing others, by a sacred art and courtship, to amend their lives; and all this with a most particular grace, and un-imitable fashion of speaking.</p>
   <p>That Summer, the same month in which he was ordained Priest, (and made the Kings Chaplaine) his Majestie (going his Progresse) was intreated to receive an entertainment in the University of Cambridge, and M. <hi>Donne</hi> attending his Majestie there, his Majestie was pleased to recommend him to be made Doctor in Divinity, Doctor <hi>Harsnet</hi> (after Archbishop of York) being then their Vice-Chancellour, who knowing him to be the Author of the <hi>Pseudo-Martyr,</hi> did propose it to the University, and they presently granted it, expressing a gladnesse they had an occasion to entitle and write him Theits.</p>
   <p>His abilities and industry in his profession were so eminent, and he so much loved by many persons of quality, that within one yeare after his entrance
<pb facs="9"/>into Sacred Orders, he had fourteen Advowsons of severall Benefices sent unto him; but they (being in the Countrey) could not draw him from his long loved friends and London, to which he had a naturall inclination, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received his birth and breeding in it: desiring rather some preferment that might fixe him to an employment in that place.</p>
   <p>Immediately after his returne from Cambridge, his wife died, leaving him a man of an unsetled estate: And (having buried five) the carefull father of seven children then living, to whom he made a voluntary promise (being then but forty two years of age) never to bring them under the subjection of a Step-mother: which promise he most faithfully kept, burying with his teares all his sublunary joyes in his most deare and deserving Wives grave, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a most retired and solitary life.</p>
   <p>In this retirednesse, he was importuned by the grave Benchers of Lincolns Inne, (once the friends of his youth) to accept of their Lecture, which (by reason of M. <hi>Gatakers</hi> removall) was then void; of which he accepted, being glad to renew his intermitted friendship with them, whom he so much lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and where he had been a <hi>Saul,</hi> (not so far as to persecute Christianity, yet in his irregular youth to neglect the practise of it) to become a <hi>Paul,</hi> and preach salvation to his brethren.</p>
   <p>Nor did he preach onely, but as S. <hi>Paul</hi> advised his <hi>Corinthians</hi> to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of him as he was of Christ; so he also was an ocular direction to them by a holy and harmlesse conversation.</p>
   <p>Their love to him was exprest many wayes; for (besides the faire lodgings that were provided and furnisht for him) other curtesies were daily accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, so many, and so freely, as though they meant their gratitude (if possible) should exceed, or at least equall his merit. In this love-strife of desert and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality, they continued for the space of three yeares, he constantly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preaching, they liberally requiting him. About which time the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of <hi>Germany</hi> died, and the Palsgrave was elected and crowned King of Bohemia, the unhappy beginning of much trouble in those Kingdomes.</p>
   <p>King <hi>Iames,</hi> whose Motto, <hi>Beati Pacifici,</hi> did truly characterize his dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, endeavoured to compose the differences of that discomposed State, and to that end sent the Earle of Carlile, (then Vicount Doncaster) his Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour to those unsetled Princes, and (by a speciall command from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie) D. <hi>Donne</hi> was appointed to attend the Embassage of the said Earle to the Prince of the Union: For which the Earle (that had long knowne and loved him) was most glad: So were many of the Doctors friends, who fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his studies,<note place="margin">Gen. 47.</note> and sadnesse for his wives death, would as <hi>Iacob</hi> sayes, <hi>make his dayes few,</hi> and (respecting his bodily health) <hi>evill too.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>At his going, he left his friends of Lincolnes Inne, and they him with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reluctations; For though he could not say, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> to his Ephesians, <hi>Behold, you to whom I have preacht the kingdome of God, shall henceforth see my face no more;</hi> yet he (being in a Consumption) questioned it, and they feared it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering his troubled minde, which, with the helpe of his un-intermitted stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, hastned the decayes of his weake body; But God turned it to the best, for this imployment did not onely divert him from those serious studies and
<pb facs="9"/>sad thoughts, but gave him a new and true occasion of joy, to be an eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the health of his honoured Mistris, the Queene of Bohemia, in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Land, (who having formerly knowne him a Courtier) was most glad to see him in a Canonicall habit, and more glad to be an eare-witnesse of his most excellent and powerfull preaching.</p>
   <p>Within fourteen moneths he returned to his friends of Lincolnes Inne, with his sorrowes much moderated, and his health improved.</p>
   <p>About a yeare after his returne from Germany, D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
      <hi>Cary</hi> was made Bishop of Exeter, and by his removall, the Deanry of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> being vacant, the King appointed Doctor <hi>Donne</hi> to waite on him at dinner the next day; And his Majesty (being set downe) before he eat any meat, said (after his pleasant manner) <hi>Doctor Donne, I have invited you to dinner, And though you sit not downe with me, yet I will carve to you of a dish that I know you love; you love London well, I doe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make you Deane of Pauls, take your meate home to your study, say grace, and much good may it doe you.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Immediately after he came to his Deanry, he imployed workmen to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire the Chappel belonging to his house;<note place="margin">Psal. 132.</note>
      <hi>Suffering</hi> (as holy <hi>David</hi> once vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) <hi>his eyes and temples to take no rest, untill he had first beautified the house of God.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The next quarter following, when his Father in Law Sir <hi>George More,</hi> who now admired and dearly loved him, came to pay him the conditioned sum of twenty pound, he denied to receive it, And said to his Father,<note place="margin">Gen. 45.</note> (as good <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> said when he beard <hi>Ioseph</hi> his sonne lived) <hi>It is enough,</hi> you have been kinde to me, and carefull of mine, I am, I thanke my God, provided for, and will receive this money no longer; And not long after freely gave up his bond of eight hundred pound.</p>
   <p>Presently after he was setled in his Deanry, the Vicarage of S. Dunstans in London fell to him by the death of Doctor <hi>White,</hi> The advowson being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly given to him by the right Honorable <hi>Richard</hi> Earle of Dorset a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, And confirmed to him by his Brother the right Honorable <hi>Edward</hi> Earle of Dorset that now lives.</p>
   <p>By these and another Ecclesiasticall Endowment (which fell to him about the same time) he was inabled to be charitable to the poore, and to make such provision for his Children, that at his death they were not left scandalous to his profession and quality.</p>
   <p>The next Parliament following he was chosen Prolocutor to the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and about that time, by the appointment of his Majesty, (his gracious Master) did preach many occasionall Sermons: All which he performed not onely with the approbation, but to the admiration of the representative body of the Clergy of this Kingdome.</p>
   <p>He was once (and but once) clouded with the Kings displeasure; It was about this time, occasioned by some malicious whisperer, which assured the King Doctor <hi>Donne</hi> had preacht a Sermon that implied a dislike of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, particularly of his late Directions that the Evening Lectures on Sundaies, should be turned into Catechizing, expounding the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Beliefe, and Lords Prayer. His Majesty was the more inclinable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve this, for that about the same time a person of the Nobility of great note
<pb facs="10"/>in the Kingdome, and favour with the King (whom his Majesty knew Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Donne</hi> loved very much) was discarded the Court, and presently after committed to prison, which begot many rumors in the multitude.</p>
   <p>The King suffered not the Sunne to set, till he had searcht out the truth of this report, but sent presently for Doctor <hi>Donne,</hi> and required his answer to the accusation: which was so satisfactory, That the King said he was glad he rested not under that suspition. Doctor <hi>Donne</hi> protested his answer was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and free from all Collusion. And therefore begged of his Majesty, that he might not rise (being then kneeling) before he had (as in like cases he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes had from God) some assurance that he stood cleere and faire in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties opinion. The King with his own hand, did, or offered to raise him from his knees, and protested he was truly satisfied, that he was an honest man, and loved him. Presently his Majesty called some Lords of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell into his Chamber, and said with much earnestnesse, <hi>My Doctor is an honest man;</hi> And my Lords, I was never more joyed in anything that I have done, then in making him a Divine.</p>
   <p>He was made Deane in the fiftieth yeare of his age; And in the fifty fourth yeare, a dangerous sicknesse seised him, which turned to a spotted Feaver, and ended in a Cough, that inclined him to a Consumption. But God (as <hi>Iob</hi> thankfully acknowledgeth) preserved his spirit, keeping his intellectualls as cleere and perfect, as when that sicknesse first seised his body. And as his health increased, so did his thankfulnesse, testified in his booke of Devotions, A book that may not unfitly be called, <hi>A composition of holy Extasies,</hi> occasioned, and appliable to the Emergencies of that sicknesse, which booke (being Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations in his sicknesse) he writ on his sicke bed; herein imitating the holy Patriarchs,<note place="margin">Gen. 12.7.8. Gen. 28.18.</note> who were wont in that place to build their Altars where they had received their blessing.</p>
   <p>This sicknesse brought him to the gates of death, and he saw the grave so ready to devoure him, that he calls his recovery supernaturall. But God resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his health, and continued it untill the fifty-ninth yeare of his life. And then in August 1630. being with his daughter Mistris <hi>Harvy</hi> at Abrey-Hatch in Essex, he fell into a Feaver, which with the helpe of his constant infirmity, <hi>vapours from the spleene,</hi> hastened him into so visible a Consumption, that his beholders might say (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> of himselfe) <hi>he dyes daily,</hi> And he might say with <hi>Iob,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Job 30.15. Job. 7.3.</note>
      <hi>My welfare passeth away as a cloud; The dayes of affliction have taken hold of me. And weary nights are appointed for me.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>This sicknesse continued long, not onely weakning, but wearing him so much, that my desire is, he may now take some rest: And that thou judge it no impertinent digression (before I speake of his death) to looke backe with me upon some observations of his life, which (while a gentle slumber seises him) may (I hope fitly) exercise thy Consideration.</p>
   <p>His marriage was the remarkable error of his life, which (though he had a wit apt enough, and very able to maintaine paradoxes; And though his wives competent yeares, and other reasons might be justly urged to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a severe censure; yet) he never seemed to justifie, and doubtlesse had repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, if God had not blest them with a mutuall, and so cordiall an affection,
<pb facs="10"/>as in the midst of their sufferings made their bread of sorrow taste more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly then the banquet of fooles.</p>
   <p>The recreations of his youth were Poetry, in which he was so happy, as if nature with all her varieties had been made to exercise his great wit, and high fancy. And in those pieces which were carelesly scattered in his younger daies (most of them being written before the twentieth yeare of his age) it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by his choice Metaphors, that all the Arts joyned to assist him with their utmost skill.</p>
   <p>It is a truth, that in his penitentiall yeares, viewing some of those pieces loosely scattered in his youth, he wisht they had been abortive, or so short-liv'd, that he had witnessed their funeralls: But though he was no friend to them, he was not so falne out with heavenly Poetry, as to forsake it, no not in his declining age, witnessed then by many divine Sonnets, and other high, holy, and harmonious composures; yea even on his former sick bed, he wrote this heavenly Hymne, expressing the great joy he then had in the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods mercy to him.</p>

   <p>And on this (which was his Death-bed) writ another Hymne which bears this Title,
<q>A Hymne to God my God in my sicknesse.</q>
   </p>
   <p>If these fall under the censure of a soule whose too much mixture with earth makes it unfit to judge of these high illuminations, let him know, that many devout and learned men have thought the soule of
<pb facs="11"/>holy <hi>Prudentius</hi> was most refined, when not many dayes before his death, he charged it to present his God each morning with a new and spirituall Song; justified by the examples of King <hi>David,</hi> and the good King <hi>Hezekias,</hi> who upon the renovation of his yeares, payed his gratefull vowes to God, in a roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all hymne,<note place="margin">Esay 38.</note> which he concludes in these words, <hi>The Lord was ready to save, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments, all the dayes of our life, in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of my God.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>The later part of his life was a continued studie, Saturdaies onely excepted, which he usually spent in visiting friends, and resting himselfe under the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry burthen of his weeks Meditations; And he gave himselfe this rest, that thereby he might be refresht and inabled to doe the work of the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not negligently, but with courage and cheerfulnesse.</p>
   <p>Nor was his age onely so industrious, but in his most unsetled youth he was (being in health) never knowne to be in bed after foure of the clock in the morning nor usually out of his chamber till ten; and imployed that time constantly (if not more) in his Studie. Which, if it seeme strange, may gain beliefe by the visible fruits of his labours: some of which remaine to testifie what is here written: for he left the resultance of 1400. Authors, most of them analyzed with his owne hand; He left sixscore Sermons also, all writ with his owne hand; A large and laborious Treatise concerning Self-murther, called <hi>Biathanatose,</hi> wherein all the Lawes violated by that act, are diligently survayed, and judiciously censured; A Treatise written in his youth, which alone might declare him then, not onely perfect in the Civil and Canon Law, but in many other such studies and arguments as enter not into the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of many profest Scholars, that labour to be thought learned Clerks, and to know all things.</p>
   <p>Nor were these onely found in his Studie, but all businesses that past of any publique consequence in this or any of our neighbour Kingdoms, he abbre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated either in Latine, or in the Language of the Nation, and kept them by him for a memoriall. So he did the Copies of divers Letters and Cases of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science that had concerned his friends, (with his solutions) and divers other businesses of importance, all particularly and methodically digested by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
   <p>He did prepare to leave the world before life left him, making his Will when no facultie of his soule was dampt or defective by sicknesse, or he sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized by sudden apprehension of death; But with mature deliberation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing himselfe an impartiall Father, by making his Childrens Portions equall; a constant lover of his friends, by particular Legacies, discreetly cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, and fitly bequeathed them; And full of charity to the poore, and many others, who by his long continued bounty might entitle themselves <hi>His almes-people.</hi> For all these he made provision, so largely, as having six children, might to some appeare more then proportionable to his estate. The Reader may think the particulars tedious, but I hope not impertinent, that I present him with the beginning and conclusion of his last Will.</p>
   <pb facs="11"/>
   <p>
      <hi>IN the name of the blessed and glorious Trinitie, Amen. I Iohn Donne, by the mercy of Christ Iesus, and the calling of the Church of England, Priest, being at this time in good and perfect understanding, (praised be God therefore) doe hereby make my last Will and Testament in manner and forme following.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>First, I give my gracious God an intire sacrifice of body and soule, with my most humble thanks for that assurance which his blessed Spirit imprints in me now of the salvation of the one, and of the resurrection of the other; And for that constant and cheerfull resolution which the same Spirit established in me, to live and die in the Religion now professed in the Church of England: In expectation of that Resurrection I desire my body may be buried (in the most private manner that may be) in that place of S.</hi> Pauls <hi>Church London, that the now Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiaries have at my request assigned for that purpose, &amp;c.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>And this my last Will and Testament made in the feare of God, (whose merit I humbly beg, and constantly rely upon in Iesus Christ) and in perfect love and charity with all the world, whose pardon I aske from the lowest of my servants to the highest of my Superiours. Written all with mine owne hand, and my name subscribed to every Page, being five in number.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Nor was his charity exprest onely at his death, but in his life, by a cheerfull and frequent visitation of friends, whose minds were dejected, or fortunes necessitous. And he redeemed many out of Prison that lay for small debts, or for their fees; He was a continuall giver to poore Scholars, both of this, and forraigne Nations; (besides what he gave with his owne hand) he usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally sent a servant to all the Prisons in London, to distribute his charity, at all festivall times in the yeare. He gave 100. l. at one time to a Gentleman that he had formerly knowne live plentifully, and was then decayed in his estate. He was a happy Reconciler of of differences in many Families of his friends and kindred, who had such faith in his judgement and impartiality, that he scarce ever advised them to any thing in vaine. He was (even to her death) a most dutifull son to his Mother, carefull to provide for her supportation, of which she had been destitute, but that God raised him up to prevent her necessities; who having suckt in the Religion of the Romane Church with her mothers milk, (or presently after it) spent her estate in forraigne Countries, to enjoy a liberty in it, and died in his house but three moneths before him.</p>
   <p>And to the end it may appeare how just a Steward he was of his Lord and Masters Revenue, I have thought fit to let the Reader know, that after his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into his Deanry, as he numbred his yeares, and (at the foot of a private account, to which God and Angels onely were witnesses with him) compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted first his Revenue, then his expences, then what was given to the poore and pious uses, lastly, what rested for him and for his, he blest each yeares poore remainder with a thankfull Prayer; which for that they discover a more then common devotion, the Reader shall partake some of them in his owne words.</p>

Amen.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But I returne from my digression.</p>
   <p>We left the Author sick in Essex, where he was forced to spend most of that Winter, by reason of his disability to remove from thence. And having never during almost twenty yeares, omitted his personall attendance on his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie, in his monthly service. Nor being ever left out of the number of Lent Preachers. And in January following, there being a generall report that he was dead, that report occasioned this Letter to a familiar friend.</p>

         <p>THis advantage you and my other friends have by my frequent feavers, that I am so much the oftner at the gates of heaven; And this advantage by the solitude and close imprisonment that they reduce me to after, that I am so much the oftner at my Prayers, in which I shall never leave out your happinesse; And I doubt not but amongst his other bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, God will adde some one to you for my Prayers.</p>
         <p>A man would be almost content to die, (if there were no other benefit in death) to heare of so much sorrow, and so much good testimony from good men, as I (God be blessed for it) did upon the report of my death: Yet I perceive it went not through all; For one writ to me, that some (and he said of my friends) conceived I was not so ill as I pretended, but withdrew my selfe to live at ease, discharged of preaching. It is an unfriendly, and (God knowes) an ungrounded interpretation; for I have alwayes been sorrier when I could not preach, then any could be they could not hear me. It hath been my desire (and God may be pleased to grant it) that I might die in the Pulpit; If not that, yet that I might take my death in the Pulpit, that is, die the sooner by occasion of those labours. Sir, I hope to see you presently after Candlemas, about which time will fall my Lent Sermon at Court, except my Lord Chamberlaine beleeve me to be dead, and leave me out: For as long as I live, and am not speechlesse, I would not willingly decline that service. I have better leasure to write, then you to reade, yet I would not willingly oppresse you with too much Letter: God blesse you and your son, as I wish</p>

   <p>Before that month ended, he was appointed to preach upon his old con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant day, the first Friday in Lent, he had notice of it; and having in his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb facs="12"/>prepared for the employment as he had long thirsted for it. So resolving his weaknesse should not hinder his journey, he came to London some few dayes before his day appointed. Being come, many of his friends (who with sorrow saw his sicknesse had left him onely so much flesh as did cover his bones) doubted his strength to performe that taske: And therefore perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him from undertaking it, assuring him however, it was like to shorten his dayes: But he passionately denyed their requests, saying, He would not doubt, that God who in many weaknesses had assisted him with an unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted strength, would now withdraw it in his last employment, professing a holy ambition to performe that sacred Work. And when (to the amazement of some beholders) he appeared in the Pulpit, many thought he presented himselfe, not to preach mortification by a living voice, but mortality by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed body, and dying face. And doubtlesse many did secretly ask that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi>

Yet after some faint pauses in his zealous Prayer, his strong desires inabled his weak body to discharge his memory of his pre conceived Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which were of dying; The Text being, <hi>To God the Lord belong the issues from death.</hi> Many that saw his teares, and heard his hollow voice, professing they thought the Text Prophetically chosen, and that D. <hi>Donne</hi> had preacht his owne Funerall Sermon.</p>
   <p>Being full of joy that God had inabled him to performe this desired duty, he hastned to his house, out of which he never moved, untill like S. <hi>Stephen,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Acts 8.</note>
      <hi>He was carried by devout men to his grave:</hi> And the next day after his Sermon, his spirits being much spent, and he indisposed to discourse, a friend asked him, Why are you sad? To whom he replyed after this manner, <q>I am not sad; I am in a serious contemplation of the mercies of my God to me; And now I plainly see, it was his hand that prevented me from all temporall employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And I see it was his will that I should never settle nor thrive untill I entred into the Ministery, in which I have now lived almost twenty yeares, (I hope to his glory) and by which (I most humbly thank him) I have been enabled to requite most of those friends that shewed me kindnesse when my fortunes were low. And (as it hath occasioned the expression of my gratitude) I thank God, most of them have stood in need of my requitall. I have been usefull and comfortable to my good Father in Law Sir <hi>George More,</hi> whose patience God hath been pleased to exercise by many temporall crosses. I have maintained my owne Mother, whom it hath pleased God after a plentifull fortune in her former times, to bring to a great decay in her very old age. I have quieted the consciences of many that groaned under the burthen of a wounded spirit, whose Prayers I hope are availeable for me. I cannot plead innocencie of life, (especially of my youth) but I am to be judged by a mercifull God, who hath given me (even at this time) some testimonies by his holy Spirit, that I am of the number of his Elect. I am ful of joy, and shall die in peace.</q>

   <p>Upon Munday following, he took his last leave of his beloved Studie, and
<pb facs="13"/>being hourely sensible of his decay, retired himselfe into his bed-chamber: and that week sent (at severall times) for many of his most considerable friends, of whom he tooke a solemne and deliberate Farewell, commending to their considerations some sentences particularly usefull for the regulation of their lives, and dismist them (as<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 49.</note>
      <hi>Iacob</hi> did his sons) with a spirituall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. The Sunday following, he appointed his servants, that if there were any worldly businesse undone, that concerned them or himselfe, it should be prepared against Saturday next; for after that day he would not mixe his thoughts with any thing that concerned the world. Nor ever did.</p>
   <p>Now he had nothing to doe but die; To doe which, he stood in need of no more time, for he had long studied it, and to such a perfection, that in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer sicknesse he called God to witnesse,<note place="margin">Devot. Prayer 23.</note> he was that minute prepared to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his soule into his hands, if that minute God would accept of his dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In that sicknesse he begged of his God, (the God of constancy) to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in that estate for ever. And his patient expectation to have his immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall soule disrobed from her garment of mortality, makes me confident he now had a modest assurance, that his prayers were then heard, and his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition granted. He lay fifteene dayes earnestly expecting his hourely change; And in the last houre of his last day, (as his body melted away, and vapoured into spirit) his soule having (I verily beleeve) some revelation of the Beatifical Vision, he said, <hi>I were miserable, if I might not die:</hi> And after those words, closed many periods of his faint breath with these words, <hi>Thy kingdome come, Thy will be done.</hi> His speech which had long been his faithfull servant, remained with him till his last minute; and then forsook him, not to serve another master, but died before him, for that it was uselesse to him, who now conversed with God on earth, (as Angels are said to doe in heaven) onely by thoughts and looks. Being speechlesse, he did (as S. <hi>Stephen</hi>) <hi>look stedfastly towards heaven,</hi> till he saw the Sonne of God standing at the right hand of his Father; And being satisfied with this blessed sight, (as his soule ascended, and his last breath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from him) he closed his owne eyes, and then disposed his hands and body into such a posture, as required no alteration by those that came to shroud him.</p>
   <p>Thus <hi>variable,</hi> thus <hi>vertuous</hi> was the <hi>life,</hi> thus <hi>memorable,</hi> thus <hi>exemplary</hi> was the <hi>death</hi> of this most excellent man.</p>
   <p>He was buried in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church, in that place which he had appointed for that use, some yeares before his death, and by which he passed daily to his devotions. But not buried privately, though he desired it; For (besides an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbred number of others) many persons of Nobility and eminency, who did love and honour him in his life, did shew it at his Funerall, by a volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and very sad attendance of his body to the grave.</p>
   <p>To which (after his buriall) some mournfull friends repaired: And as <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great did to the grave of the famous <hi>Achillis,</hi>
      <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> so they strewed his with curious and costly flowers. Which course they (who were never yet knowne) continued each morning and evening for divers dayes, not ceasing till the stones that were taken up in that Church to give his body admission into the cold earth, (now his bed of rest) were againe by the Masons art level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb facs="13"/>and firmed, as they had been formerly, and his place of buriall undistin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishable to common view.</p>
   <p>Nor was this (though not usuall) all the honour done to his reverend ashes; for by some good body, (who, tis like thought his memory ought to be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated) there was 100. marks sent to his two faithfull friends<note n="*" place="margin">
         <hi>D.</hi> Henry King. <hi>D.</hi> Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</note> and Executors, (the person that sent it, not yet known, they look not for a reward on earth) towards the making of a Monument for him, which I think is as lively a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation, as in dead marble can be made of him.</p>
   <p>
      <hi>HE was of stature moderately tall; of a straight and equally proportioned body, to which all his words and actions gave an unexpressible addition of comelinesse.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>His aspect was cheerfull, and such as gave a silent testimony of a cleere knowing soule, and of a conscience at peace with it selfe.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>His melting eye shewed he had a soft heart, full of noble pity, of too brave a spirit to offer injuries, and too much a Christian, not to pardon them in others.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>His fancie was un-imitable high, equalled by his great wit, both being made usefull by a commanding judgement.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>His mind was liberall, and unwearied in the search of knowledge, with which his vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous soule is now satisfied, and employed in a continuall praise of that God that first breathed it into his active body, which once was a Temple of the holy Ghost, and is now become a small quantity of Christian dust. But I shall see it re-inanimated.</hi>
