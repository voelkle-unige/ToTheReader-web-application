   <p>INfinite and vnspeakeable (Christian Reader) are the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
from which Jesus Christ our Sauiour hath freed vs, and
the benefites and blessings, wherewith in this life he beginneth
and for euer will continue to adorne vs. The consideration wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
(if our vnthankfulnes vnto his Maiesty, were any way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porcionable,
to that which we indeuour vnto towards men) should
make vs continually to deuise, and all the dayes of our life to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
how we might shew our selues (at least in some sort) carefull to
glorifie his blessed name, aboue all thinges that we desire, by how
much as his loue towardes vs, excelleth whatsoeuer can els (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to our wish) befall vnto vs: but if wee doe with equall bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
(on the other side) looke into the course of mans life, how wel
this duetie is performed, we shall see, that men declare themselues
rather bent to spit in his face, &amp; to defie him, then any way to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
him as their head and Soueraigne: for (to say nothing of
the prophane life, and godlesse conuersation, wherewith the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
number, that professeth Iesus Christ, is wholy defiled (wee
see that many nations, people, and languages are very willing to
receiue Iesus Christe as their Priest to sacrifice for their sinnes,
but that hee shoulde become their King, to prescribe lawes vnto
them, whereby they may be ruled, is of all other thinges the moste
vnsauorie, yea (if it offered) the most grieuous tidings, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
request: wherein, albeit manie nations that haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
that whoore of Rome, are heynously sinnefull against his
glorious Maiestie: yet is there none in the whole worlde so
farre out of square as England, in reteyning that Popish Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie,
first coyned in the midst of the Mysterie of iniquitie, and
that filthie sincke of the Canon law, which was inuented &amp; pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
togeather for the confirming and increasing of the kingdome
of Antichriste: Wherein as great indignitie is offered vnto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christe, in committing his Churche vnto the gouernment of
the same, as can bee, by meane vnderlinges vnto a King, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
his beloued spouse vnto the direction of the Mystresse of
the Stewes, and inforcing her to liue after the orders of a Brothel
house. For the reformation whereof, while some haue written,
and others according to their callinges, carefully stoode, how hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nously
<pb n="8" facs="5"/>
it hath been taken, howe hardly they haue been vsed, and
what shamefull reproches haue been offered (euen vnto the course
of the Gospell) for spite that hath beene borne vnto reformation,
almost by all estates and degrees, lamentable experience hath
taught many of vs: but our posteritie shall knowe it more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularlie,
and the Church throughout the world shall discorne and
iudge of it more euidently, when their bodies are rotten in the
dust, and their soules (if they repent not) in eternall and intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
torments, who haue rezected a request so holy, profitable and
reasonable, yea, &amp; handeled the intreaters for the same so cruelly,
vnchristianly, and vnlawfully: but they would gladly perswade
themselues (if their conscience would let them) that they haue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
executed iustice vpon vs as malefactors, and they perswade
men that we desire a thing, not warranted by the worde, not heard
of in the Church of God, vntill within this fewyeares, nor tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in any Christian Common-weal whatsoeuer: The which
monstrous slaunders, albeit they haue been many wayes, and by
many men of moste worthie giftes detected, and made knowne in
those seuerall bookes that haue beene published concerning the
same: yet haue I thought it necessarie (in an other course) to write
also of it. The course of my enterprise, is first in respect of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorers
of the desired reformation: secondlie of the aduersaries of
the saeme: the fauorers of it, are also of two sorts, Ministers of the
word, &amp; priuate persons, &amp; both I hope may haue profit by it. Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cerning
the former, when these woefull troublees that were renued
vppon vs (by that wretched subscription, that was euery where
vrged) did begin to increase, I thought it meete to betake my selfe
vnto that which I had read, or might any way by studie finde
out, concerning the cause, and collected all into a briefe summe, &amp;
referred euery thing vnto some head, which beeing euer present
with mee, might furnishe mee to aunswere in the defence of the
trueth, though it were of a sodaine, by which (thorow the blessing
of God) I found such profit in my seuerall troubles, that I thought
it a course not altogether vnprofitable for others also, and vpon
that occasion betooke my selfe vnto a more serious meditation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the matter, and communicating the thing with diuers verie
worthie men, I founde encouragement and heartening on, general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
by all whom I made acquainted therewith: so that I trust (the
<pb n="9" facs="5"/>
iudgements, yea and wishes also of others so iumping with mine)
manie Ministers that loue the cause, and haue not so through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
studied as were meet they should, may reape some profite ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.
Now concerning priuate men that loue the cause, some haue
great affaires in hande, and haue no leasure to reade the seuerall
bookes of this argument: some when they reade, are not of suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
capacitie to conceiue the force of a reason, or to make vse of it,
to informe themselues in the grounded knowledge of the cause
thereby: some (which is the generall fault of our religious Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men)
will take no paines to reade, some are poore, and not able to
buye the bookes, which might let them see the cause, all these (I
hoope) may finde helpe in some measure heereby. Nowe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the aduersaries vnto the cause, they are of two sortes also,
they that know it, and they that are ignorant of it: the former, if
they write any thing against it, are contented to deale in so rouing
a course as may rather arise vnto great volumes, then soundlie to
say any thing against the cause: Wherein D. <hi>Whitgift,</hi> but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially.
D. <hi>Bridges,</hi> haue giuen vs an euident example: and these
with others of their iudgement (though none in these latter dayes
haue written more vnlearnedly then they, of any argument of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie
what soeuer) are contented to make the world beleeue (if
men will be so wilfully seduced) that our argumentes bee no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that they be grounded vpon false foundations, and that we
are not able to conclude our cause in any forme of reasoning. The
course that is heere taken (I trust) shall shewe that they are lyers:
the other sort of aduersaries be they that be meerly ignorant of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
thing, either for it or against it, and perswading themselues
that the sway and shew of the worlde must needes carry the truth
with it, doe (like blinde bayardes) boldly venture to say any thing
against it, and thinke they doe well. Now of all these sorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
I haue to request some thing I hope I shall obtaine my request
(at the least) at the handes of some of them. The first sort of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorers
(which be the Ministers) I intreate, that as they tender
the glory of God, and honour of the cause which they stand in, so
they would diligently employ themselues in this, that they may
be found able to defend the same by sounde and euident groundes
out of the worde, and so much the rather, for that the aduersaries
doe greatly triumph, when they meete with one that professeth the
<pb n="10" facs="6"/>
cause, and is not able to defend it, and confute the gaine sayers of
it. The second sort of fauourers, be the priuate persons that loue
the cause, whom I beseech to be carefull (as of all other pointes of
religion) of this, that they grow in the knowledge of the worde of
God, whereby they may be able, vpon their owne knowledge to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende
the trueth, and not giue the enemie any occasion to thinke or
say, that they be of that minde, because such and such Ministers,
whom they doe affect, doe thinke so. Now concerning the former
sort of aduersaries, to wit, they that know it, I pray them to looke
into their own hearts, &amp; they shall finde they mislike it, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it correcteth their excessiue pompe and maintenance, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
more trauaile in their Ministerie, then they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to vndergoe, or at the least, controlleth that dissolutenesse of
behauiour, wherein they willingly wallow: and if it would please
God to bring them to a serious meditation of this, that it is the
will of the mightie God (before whom they must be called to giue
an account) which they doe resist, they would (I doubt not) more
carefully looke about them. And lastly for them that be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the cause, speake euill of that they knowe not: let them (if
they will be admonished) vouchsafe to reade this little booke, and
wey the reasons with an vpright iudgement, which shall cause
them (at the least) to suspend their sharpe censures, which so vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie
appeare in their ordinarie communication: and concerning
vs all, let vs know (for one day we shall be sure to feele it) that the
controuersie is not about goates wooll (as the Prouerbe faith) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
light &amp; trifling matters, which may safely be followed or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected
(as in deed the enemies of this cause do confidentlie affirm)
but about no lesse matter then this, whether Iesus Christ shall be
King or no: For if none is said to be a King but he that ruleth by
the scepter of his lawes, thē the turning out of these orders which
Christ hath prescribed in his word, for the ruling of the church,
is to giue him the title, and denie him the authoritie belonging to
the same, and so (in trueth) to make him an Idoll, making him to
carrie a shew of that which hee is not, and (with the crucifiers of
him) to put a reede in his hand, in steed of his yron rod, and crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
him with thornes, in steede of the crowne of greatest glorie,
which is the cause that so many Atheistes spit in his face, and so
many godlesse persons, doe make but a iest of him: but when hee
<pb n="11" facs="6"/>
commeth to shewe him self in his glorious maiestie, it shalbe said
vnto all these sortes of aduersaries: <hi>Those mine enimies which
would not that I should raigne ouer them, bring hither, and
slea them before me, Luke</hi> 19. 27. The whiche fearefull sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
that we may auoide, let euery one of vs (ae may stande with
our seuerall callings) carefully endeuour, to aduaunce this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
here, whiche (among other assurances giuen vs from the
Lord) shalbe a testimonie vnto vs, that we shall haue part in that
glorie, which shalbe reuealed hereafter. Nowe concerning the
order of this booke, to direst thee (good Reader) vnto thy further
instruction, in the pointes therof: Thou hast in euery chapter di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
proofes out of the holy worde of God, whiche must bee the
things wherewith thou mayest safely informe thy conscience: thē
shalt thou finde (also) argumentes drawen from reason rightlie
ruled by the same word: &amp; lastly, (because our aduersaries charg
vs, that we desire a thing not knowen vnto the olde writers, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
vpon among the newe) thou hast here the witnes of them
both, in so plentifull and vniforme wise as may plainly declare,
that all godly learned men of all times, haue giuen testimonie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the trueth of it. The most of the things that are here expressed,
I acknowledge to be gathered out of the bookes that haue bin pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
and are extant (purposelie) concerning this argument, as
may appeare in the seuerall points, wherein thou art sent vnto
them. Nowe least eyther thou shouldest bee deceyued with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
impression, or thinke me to misalleadge the authours, I am
to shew thee what bookees I haue followed. The 1. booke of T. C.
twise printed, I follow the latter, of Ecclesiasticall Discipline
I followe the Latine, printed 1574. and the last booke of D.
Whitgift, which containeth all the former in it. The rest (as I
take it) haue beene but once printed, and therefore carrie no doubt
in them. If thou be satisfied herewith, giue God the glory: and
promote the cause by prayer, &amp; all other good means that
thy calling may affoord: and pray for vs, that
we may neuer shrinke, nor be ouerthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
by the strength of them
that fight against it.</p>
