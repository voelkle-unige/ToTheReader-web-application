   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I doe consider <hi>(benevolent Reader)</hi> the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience whereinto that Man is plunged, who brings himselfe upon the publique Stage of promulgating his Bookes in print, be the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject never so laudable, and the Author no lesse cautelous and sufficient, endeavouring with all diligence to prevent the brand of a black cole: neverthelesse all industry applyed, he shall not passe without oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy and aspersion.</p>
   <p>This very consideration hath so afrighted and deterred me, that albeit I have had many great motives exciting me to make a tender of the Love, Duty, and Service I beare to my Country; yet when I doe contemplate the many censures I must undergoe, I have beene evermore disheartened as well from beginning, as going forwards in this my desired purpose. Notwithstanding partly through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect I beare to my Countries profit and honour, and partly by meanes of the importunity of many my right Noble and generous friends, who have been eye-witnesses to sundry of my Cures, and those not a few uncouth and rare: I have adventured even now in my declining dayes, to leave this Work as a Monument to ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times, no whit doubting, but that the judicious will friendly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thereof; but as for the malevolent and ignorant, I am most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that the quils they shall dart at me, cannot goe as from a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupine, and therefore will do me the lesse hurt or domage.</p>
   <p>I therefore am bold to put into thy hand, this poore work of mine, which I have digested into tw Bookes: In the first, I lay thee down rudiments how thou mayest breed Horses to thy best advantage and liking; which albeit they may appeare unto thee to be recent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, yet if thou wilt be pleased to put them in ure, and make try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all (not digressing from my principles) thou wilt (I doe assure me) be so farre from disliking them, as never hereafter to swarve or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from them. For if we shall seriously ruminate in how high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme that man is who is owner and possessor of good Horses, how much commended, how much respected, how much talked of, and how well proffered for them: but when he shall be knowne to be a
<pb facs="7"/> breeder of such good Horses, will not his <hi>encomiums</hi> be the greater? but when together with these himselfe shall be known to be exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site in Horsemanship, whereby to cause his Horse to shew himselfe in his Pace, Menage, and all other his postures like as well becomes a right good Horse, perfectly mouthed, delicately borne, obedient to the hand, and to answer the Switch and Spur, will not (I say) that Gentleman be highly commended, and have more eyes upon him as he passeth a long, than are commonly cast upon a Comet or the Sun eclipsed? yes undoubtedly. For if we doe but note when a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Horse passeth along, we may observe the people not onely gaze upon him as he commeth towards and against them, but to turn themselves and looke after him so long time as he continueth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their view and sight: Mans love to the Horse is generally so great.</p>
   <p>Sithence then the Horse is a creature so generous, and therefore so much liked and beloved of all, in my poore judgement, it should suit very well with every Gentleman of worth, ranke, and quality, to endeavour (if not to breed, yet at least) to be masters of such Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses (which he must keep) that shall be truely handsome and comely, rightly bred, of good colour, cleane shape, well marked, and singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly well ridden and made, and so he shall the better advance his honour and reputation.</p>
   <p>Having now bred, or otherwise by thy diligent endeavours attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto such Horses as be truely good, and for thy turne; the second thing to be thought of, is, if they be not already made unto thy hand as thou desirest to have them, that thou then doe procure such a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who is known to be a master of his Art, or otherwise thou wilt be much deceived, and farre to seeke of enjoying thy wished desires, and therefore I have given thee instructions how to make thy choice of such a man, whereby thou shalt not be wronged in thy expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor thy Horse marred in his first making and handling. Neither have I taken upon me to teach him his Art, (for that were a thing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry impertinent) but those documents which I have set thee downe must serve onely to shew thee how thou shouldest soone finde whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Rider may be for thy turne or not.</p>
   <p>The third thing which thou art to take to thy consideration, is, the good or harme that may come unto thee by the choice thou makest of thy Groome or Keeper, who may either through his ignorance, or inconsideration, soone make him unfit both for thy owne use, or any mans else: out of which reason I have depainted thee a Groom in his lively colours, and if his conditions and qualities shall be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than what I have delineated, assure thy selfe thou dost runne a manifest hazard of marring that Horse thou didst hope should have been to thy hearts desire. And forasmuch as it is a matter very much praise-worthy to be a Master of good Horses, to have them made perfect and ready, to have such Riders, Keepers, and Groomes, as be
<pb facs="7"/> very perite in their faculties; yet if thy Stable be not every way sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and correspondent, much disprofit and inconvenience may ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by soone redound to thy Horse. I have therefore prescribed thee the meanes how thou mayest have a perfect and good Stable, with all commodities and accoutrements thereunto belonging: and therefore if thou wilt be pleased to make use of these my rudiments, and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually observe these my grounds and principles, assure thy selfe thou wilt in short time aspire to that which will be thy honour and renown.</p>
   <p>And to the end thou mayest the more perfectly and easily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the full drift and summe of this my first Booke, I will here give unto thee an Epitome of it in a few lines, which may doe thee much pleasure in the perusall thereof.</p>
   <p>In the Introduction, I shew thee how needfull a creature the Horse is beyond all others, and what admirable things Horses in former times have perpetrated and done, whereof I produce thee instances of the famous acts of sundry brave and generous Horses, whose love to their Masters have been so great great, as hardly to be credited, if ancient Histories and Annals of good integrity, had not engraven them in the memory of never-dying posterity. We reade of <hi>Bucepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> what he did for the good, life, and safety of his Master; of the Horse of <hi>Dionysius,</hi> with what undaunted courage he comported him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in battell for the reliefe and succour of his Lord; it is recorded also of the Horse of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> what ill successe befell <hi>Centurettus,</hi> who when he had slaine <hi>Antiochus,</hi> would needs backe the Horse of his slaine Master. It is also noted what inly love <hi>Nicomedes</hi> his Horse bare to his Lord and Master, when after his death of meere griefe, famished himselfe. We reade of <hi>Aethon,</hi> the Horse of <hi>Pallas,</hi> who was evidently observed and seen to weep at the funerall of his Master. <hi>Silius</hi> makes report of two famous Horses called <hi>Pelorus</hi> and <hi>Ciraeus,</hi> the one eminent for his prowesse and hardinesse in warre, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his unparalelled swiftnesse. Moreover we may reade, how that this poore creature hath so well merited of man, as that many have erected Monuments and Sepulchers, celebrated Exequies, buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and founded munificent Cities, set up Pyramidies, made Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphs, erected goodly Statues, instituted Playes and Games; and all these in honour of the Horse; besides many other remarkable things right worthy of note.</p>
   <p>In the way of Breeding, I do intimate unto thee the manner how, the season when, the place where, together with the colours, marks, and shapes as well of thy Stalions, as of thy Race, or Stud Mares, and from what defects they must be free: what Signes are best wherein to cover, what course to take with them that they may conceive, what exercise is fittest for them as well when they be with Fole, as after foling; how to cherish thy Mares when their Colts shall runne by them, and how to breed up thy Colts till they come to handling,
<pb facs="8"/> backing, and riding, with other circumstances very necessary to be known: and thus much briefly for the first Book.</p>
   <p>The second Booke consisteth chiefly of the manner how thou mayest cure all such diseases and maladies (both intrinsecall and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecall) whereunto either the life of the Horse, or any of his limbs or members may be any way endamaged or in danger. This I have handled by way of familiar Dialogue, which I hold to be best, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyding of prolix and over-tedious discourses, by reason it will ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much help the memory of the Reader, and keep his minde the better attent upon the state of the Question or subject in hand, and by that meanes I may my selfe be the better able also to explicate and deliver my meaning, much more cleerely. In which Dialogue, I have introduced as prolocutors, three persons onely, <hi>viz.</hi> First, <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pophilus</hi> a Gentleman, one who is the true lover of the Horse: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Hippiatrus</hi> the Ferrier or Marishall, one most expert in Horse-leech craft: And thirdly, <hi>Hipposerus</hi> his Servant or Iourney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, sometimes his apprentice bred up by him, from whom <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serus</hi> hath had his education and knowledge in this Art: these be all the <hi>Dramatis personae</hi> to this Scene. Wherefore in the first Chapter, I doe endeavour to illustrate unto thee the true Office of the Ferrier, wherein I do produce an exact examen of his function.</p>
   <p>In the second Chapter, I do inculcate as well the causes of health as of sicknesse, wherein I make an abridgement of all those things which all learned Physitians and Chirurgions (both antient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern do from the grounds and principles of profound Philosophy) finde to govern and beare rule in the body of the Horse, without which he can have no flesh, bones, sinewes, bloud, or life it selfe, wherewith to make up the entire structure of an orginall body, and such are first the Elements; secondly, the Humours, thirdly, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall faculties; fourthly, the instrumentall members; fifthly, the spirits animall; sixtly, the spirits vitall; seventhly, the naturall parts, and so of the residue. And having sufficiently discussed all these things in due order and method, I do then shew thee what meanes we have to preserve the Horse from all inward diseases, which I doe finde to be foure in number, <hi>viz.</hi> By Purge, by Sweat, by Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy, and by Vomit: and then I do proceed to inculcate unto thee the causes of health and long life, which I do make to be in number twelve, which if thou do well observe, they will redound to thy great utility and profit.</p>
   <p>In the third Chapter I do demonstrate certaine things most befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Ferrier to know and understand well, before he shall take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to administer: in the handling whereof I do begin first with the foure Elements, anatomizing unto thee their true natures and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and how and where they be scituate, things most needfull to be known; then I goe along with the two proper Elements, shewing from whence the seed and menstruall bloud is ingendred, then I passe
<pb facs="8"/> forwards in intreating of the foure Humours, explaining their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and vertues, poynting unto the places of their abode and resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and what relation and coherence they have unto the foure Complexions, I do also shew thee what are the two spirits animall, and the two vitall, their natures vertues, and places of abode and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence in the body of the Horse. After all this I shew thee, that by duly observing the complexion of the Horse thou art to cure, thou mayest thereby the sooner, better, and with more security and ease, perfect thy Cure; nay, I goe yet further with thee, in shewing unto thee an exact way whereby to know by the complexion it selfe, the diseases whereunto the Horse is most propense; then I make known what be the causes of the evill dispositions of the Horse, which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and begetteth unavoydable infirmity and sicknesse, whereof they be two in number, <hi>viz.</hi> Intrinsecall and Extrinsecall, together with a definition of the nature of sicknesse; and so I go along in teaching thee the manner how thou oughtest to administer such Drinks, Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Clisters, and Medicines, without any the least perill to thy Horse, as also the time of the day most suteable to that purpose: and what exercise is most requisite to be had after Physicke or Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine. And lastly I come to touch briefly upon his urine and ordure, whereby to give the rules infallible how to know and understand the true state of the body of the Horse as well in health as in sicknesse.</p>
   <p>In the fourth Chapter of this second Book, I do begin to handle the Cures in particular, wherein I run a course by my selfe, which I have not known any before me undertake: for whereas Master <hi>Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devile,</hi> Master <hi>Markham,</hi> and others, do begin with all the inward diseases which are to be cured by way of Physicke, and then with the outward maladies which doe appertain unto Chirurgery; I have thought it much better to take the diseases Alphabetically, mixing the extrinsecall with the intrinsecall, by which meanes they will the sooner and more easily be found, and turned unto more readily. And wheresoever you shall finde this ✚ mark inserted in the end of any cure, I have set the same there, to let you know that receit to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted, and approved for good and certaine, being by my selfe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten practised and used. And those receits that have not the mark, are such Cures which I did procure from sundry able Ferriers, whereof I have had no tryall or experience at all, for want of time and means, and therefore dare not avouch or cry them up for mathematicall, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they do appear unto me to be probably good, but by reason I have not tryed them, I would not adventure a <hi>probatum,</hi> or <hi>ecce</hi> upon them. Neverthelesse if God permit me to reprint, I doubt not but by that time to give them for approved and warrantable, and to adde many more unto them which I have already by me, which I do for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to publish at this present, albeit I do know many of them to be as probably good as any of those.</p>
   <p>In the other Chapters I goe cleane through the whole Alphabet,
<pb facs="9"/> according to that Method used in that 4th. Chapter; and therfore let this abstract suffice for the present. And forasmuch as I have discussed the former things of Breeding, &amp;c. in my first Booke: Yet my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not at the first to trench so deepe into that subject, but to shew principally the <hi>Ferriers</hi> Craft and Art, out of an earnest desire I have to excite &amp; stir up our yong Gentlemen to assume some know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a Mystery so necessary for them to apprehend, or at least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to have a glimpse of, considering how rare a thing it is to finde a skilfull <hi>Ferrier</hi> among our rurall or Countrey <hi>Smiths.</hi> For if the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility &amp; Gentry of this our Ile of <hi>Great Britaine</hi> did truly know how honourable, and how commendable Horsemanship were, and how much they are esteemed and admired, who are the true professours thereof, they would labour more than they now doe, to breed and have good Horses; but it much troubleth me to see how little esteeme Gentlemen now a dayes have thereof. Some Horses they have, though not for Menage, yet for Hunting; but what manner of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting? Fox-hunting forsooth, or Harriers which be as fleete as petty Grey-hounds wherewith they do so much over-straine the strength of their poore Horses (forcing them over deepe-Fallowes, tough-Clayes, and wet and rough Lands) that albeit those Horses be strong and able, yet are they so toyled out therewith, as that when they come home at night, they would pitty the heart of him who loveth a Horse, to see them so be mired, blouded, spurred, lamentably spent, and tyred out: Whereas if such Horses had beene ridden to the great Saddle and Cannon, they would have infinitely delighted all men who should have beheld them.</p>
   <p>But let mee leave them vnto their toylesome sports, and let my speech bee directed to such Heroique and Generous Spirits, who have a desire to informe and better their understanding in the secrets of this brave Mysterie; who if they have a will to bee edoctrinated therein, then for a Mathematicall ground of true Horse-manship, I must tell them, that they having and possessing of good Horses, yea and Riding it self is little worth without the knowledge of the <hi>Ferri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> Craft, at the least in the Theorique or Speculative part, if not in the Practique: and therefore I could wish that every worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman should have a good insight thereinto, albeit he doth not make it his Trade, Occupation; or frequent practise and profession. Yet it will not be amisse, he be able to know every disease in a Horse, its Symtomes, and how it commeth, together with the true signe therof, which indeed is a matter of very great consequence. For when a Nobleman <hi>(V. G.)</hi> Knight, or Gentleman shall have a Horse that doth well merit his affection, and which shall be for his turne, if any accident or Malady shall befall him, albeit he may not himselfe take upon him the Cure, and to Drench, Bloudy, or Dresse him with his owne hands; yet (sending for a <hi>Ferrier</hi>) he may discourse with him upon the Nature of the Disease, and thereby come to understand
<pb facs="9"/> whether the <hi>Ferrier</hi> speaketh according to Art or not, and whether his intended course of administring, be answerable to true Art &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Science, and probably a secure way to perfect the Cure; so as if the Master and Owner of the Horse be not himselfe enabled with some superficiall knowledge at the least, at what time he shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult with the <hi>Ferrier,</hi> if not, (I say) able to iudge of the Mans suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency (the Smith himselfe being indeed insufficient) by mistaking the Infirmity, he may ignorantly administer or apply such contrary Medicine, whereby insteed of labouring to cure him, hee shall most easily and infallibly kill him, to the no small regreet and griefe of the Owner.</p>
   <p>But <hi>Ferriers</hi> and <hi>Smiths</hi> may peradventure greatly repine, and grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the publication of this Worke of mine, like as to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, &amp; in my hearing, they have most virulently exclaimed, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently inveighed against Master <hi>Blundevile,</hi> Master <hi>Markham,</hi> and others, wishing their Bookes burned, and the Authours at the Goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyere, for publishing and Printing them: pretending much wrong to be done, to such poore men who have served Apprentiships to the Trade, having none other way or meanes of livelyhood but onely this. But hereunto I answere, that these Men have no cause at all to feare any preiudice thereby; and I dare boldly affirme the promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Bookes will be so far from their harme or hinderance as that it will be infinitly to their benefit: for when they shall find any one Nobleman, Knight, or Gentleman who will undergoe so much paines as eyther to Bloudy, Drench, Corosive, Cauterize, apply Cataplasines, Emplaysters, Powders, Vnguents, or the like to his Horse, whatsoever he hath attained unto by reading, or otherwise; you shall have a thousand who upon any the least occasion will send for a <hi>Ferrier</hi> to take the Cure in hand. Againe, insteed of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended preiudice, this commodity will accrew to my brethren <hi>Smiths, Marishalls,</hi> and <hi>Ferriers, viz.</hi> they shall (by promulgation of Bookes of this Nature) become much more able, and <hi>Imbui in stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dijs,</hi> that is, much more learned and indoctrinated in this generous Faculty then ever they were before, by which meanes they will bee esteemed much more famous and eminent, and cryed up for most expert and able Men in this Noble Science. For how commeth it to passe, that Physitians, Chyrurgions, Lawyers, Divines, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Artists doe become so great Doctors of their Arts and Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and admired for most famous and learned Men, and so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetly sought after, enquired out, and sent for when occasion is? Is it not for what they have attained unto by study and reading, untill which time they were not so hardy as to adventure upon practise? so as without their Library, they could never have been able to have attained unto that eminent knowledge they have afterwards aspired unto; neyther could they otherwise have beene possibly able to practise and worke by true Art and Science. For the Workes of
<pb facs="10"/> learned and eminent Men, is the only thing that doth enable them, which are left as a never-dying Monument to ensuing and endlesse Posterity, as the common good to the weale publique, even to all ensuing Ages: Imitating therein the ancient Sages of <hi>Greece,</hi> that when any man had invented that thing which was knowne to bee commodious to the Re-publique, least the thing should bee buryed with the Inventer, and by that meanes taked up with him in the ashes of perpetuall oblivion: they ordained that the first Inventer should set up his Science be or knowne by way of Record in their publique Schooles in spacious Tables and in Capitall Characters of gold with with this Impresse, or Title, <hi>viz.</hi>

   <p>During the time of my travels, I have for my better indemnity, not only perused what Authours I cold meete with, who have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon this Subject; but I did also make my selfe an Eye witnesse to the Cures of the most famous <hi>Marishals</hi> and <hi>Ferriers,</hi> the Cities, and places afforded where I came, omitting no diligence which might informe or enable my knowledge: neyther would I bee too credulous, or give too much beliefe to fame or reports, for we have a Maxime in the civill-Law, which saith: <hi>Fama p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And truly thus much I am able to speake, that <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> (for that in those two places I had most commerce and experience, albeit I travelled many other parts of Christendome) were the two Kingdomes in which I found the best, ablest, and most expert <hi>Marishalls,</hi> or <hi>Ferri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi> but of all the places where ever yet I came, I am able of my own knowledge to say thus much (and that with no small griefe) that the worst <hi>Ferriers</hi> generally I doe find to be those who are of our owne Nation: neverthelesse, I do not conclude or condemne all for insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, for some there be well knowne unto me very quaint and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert <hi>Ferriers,</hi> who can worke very well, and according to true Art and Method. I have therefore in this illaborat Work of mine given you severall Receipts for every Cure, and most of them approved by my perticular practise and experience; Others againe I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
<pb facs="10"/> which are the Cures of other able men, which by reason they do sound probable unto me, I have suffred them to passe among my owne, (though I never had meanes or opportunity to make triall of them.) And the reason why I have inculcated so many severall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts to each Cure, are two; <hi>viz.</hi> First because that Receipt which will Cure one disease, will not alwaies cure the same Malady in an other Horse. Secondly, you shall find some Receipts eyther very difficile to make, or the Ingredients not easie to be gotten, otherwise they prove more chargeable than the Owner of the Horse is well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to defray: and therefore I have given the Receipts for all sorts and degrees of Horses; howbeit those Receipts which are most cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and intricate to make and compound are commonly the very best, and worketh the best effects, and therefore I leave thee to thy selfe to make thy owne choyce.</p>
   <p>Now if any man shall say, that I have robbed or rifled other mens labours: I answere, I have not robbed, but approved them: for by the same rule I may as well object, that whosoever worketh by my Booke robbeth me, for if that be theft, I pray what Physition is there in the whole world, (promulgating his Science) may not be as much censured and accused for rifling the Aphorismes of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates,</hi> yea and of others the Ancients and Moderne Authours also. But howsoever, I am so far from traducing other mens endeavours, as that I doe both reverence and admire them, and esteeme my selfe unworthy their Scholler. But I know no reason why I may not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish my knowledge of this Noble Art, for what saith a venerable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour <hi>Qui se dicit scire quod nescit, temerarius est: et qui negat scire quod scit, ingratus est.</hi> As that man is to be accompted for most temerari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and rash, that shall take upon him to know that which in truth he knoweth not; so also doth he shew himselfe to be most ingrate, who denyeth to know that thing which truly he doth know. Innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are the grounds which may be laid to the rearing of this Structure, which being so well knowne to all, by setting each downe in perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, I shall therein but only <hi>Sisyphi saxum volvere;</hi> consume much time (which to me is most pretious) and labour to little purpose, and lesse profit; and therefore I will in this discourse draw towards an end, least I might tire thee out with too long an Epistle; Yet lesse I thought I could not inculcate, by reason there are many things in this worthy and noble Science, which might otherwise seeme to be very darke and abstruse, and the Cures I have (I say) carryed Dialogu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>-wise, <hi>Ne inquam et inquit saepius interponeretur;</hi> meerly to avoyd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion: For <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith well; <hi>Omne Ens naturaliter appetit suam per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionem.</hi> Every <hi>Ens,</hi> that is to say; Every man hath a naturall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension to arrive unto that perfection to which hee hath a will or desire to understand.</p>
   <p>Now the reason why I did enterlace my first Book with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and perfections which Horses in former times have atchieved,
<pb facs="11"/> as also with such rules and principles of breeding, shape, marks, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, &amp;c. was, lest otherwise I might be like to one who telleth a sick man of a soveraign medicine for his infirmity, and yet conceales from him the use thereof. And therefore I doe make it my chiefest desire, and principall intention, yea my obligation, not onely to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrate each disease, together with its cure, but also to make up all the attributes belonging to a perfect Horse, and such defects which be incident to so noble and usefull a creature, being likewise disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
   <p>If therefore it may please thee sometimes to retire thy selfe in the perusall of this Treatise, and with due and serious judgement, not so much to reflect upon the method and forme of this world, as of the matter or subject it selfe, then I doubt not but that thou wilt receive such benefit and contentment, as that thereby thou wilt be much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and enabled in thy underhanding, both for the breeding and well ordering of young Horses, and in the cure of every of their maladies.</p>
   <p>And forasmuch as I have brought this my first work to its period, which I may rightly resemble to a Structure or Building, my speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all care hath been to make it faire and beautifull to the eye, and to grace, garnish, and set it forth with varieties of divers sorts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I have been very diligent to give it all satisfaction I have been able, and therefore I have laboured to paint and polish it forth with what variety is most necessary for so exquisite a building.</p>
   <p>Lastly, sithence nothing more imports a building, then to lay a sure and substantiall foundation, and withall to make the wals so tite and impregnable, as to be able to resist not so much winde and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the violence, assaults, and battery of detracting enemies: my care therefore hath been to have it founded and scituate upon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable Rock of a pregnant truth. And therrfore considering I have applyed all this paines, and spent so much time and cost, which I might have otherwise both imployed and applyed to my more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular commodity, by which I have not onely finished this Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and made it commodious for thee, but I do also present it unto thee meerely for thy proper use and habitation; and therefore I hope that thou wilt not make such use thereof, as men do of an Inne, where he taketh a bait or repast, for one meale, or for a lodging, for one night, and away, to wit, by onely taking a superficiall view thereof: but that thou wilt make it thy abode, at the least for some time; I meane, by reading and digesting the whole worke in order as it lyeth treatably and seriously, and after by putting in practise what therein thou shalt finde to be fit for thy use; so shalt thou reape, and enjoy the benefit; my selfe the comfort, and the Common-wealth the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
   <p>If any leakes be in the printing, impute them either unto the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prision of the Printer, or else to the negligence of him unto whom
<pb facs="11"/> the charge of the correcting was committed; and if any be in the Author, let the fault light upon those who spurred him so fast on to haste it to the Presse; but howsoever shew thy charity in correcting the faults and slips, as well of the one, as of the other: So shalt thou shew thy selfe to the world like thy selfe, truely Noble, and oblige the Author to remaine ever thy humble Servant, and true Friend: Farewell.</p>
