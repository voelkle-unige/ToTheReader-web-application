Prince Henry, Queene Mary, Queene Elizabeth, and Queene Anne, wherein Spaines ambition and trecheries to most kingdoms and free estates of Europe, are vnmasked and truly represented, but more particularly towards England, and now more especially vnder the pretended match of Prince Charles with the Infanta Dona Maria. VVherunto is annexed two letters written by Queene Mary from heauen, the one to Count Gondomar, the ambassadour of Spaine, the other to all the Romane Catholiques of England.

      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O you who are the re-presentiue body of <hi>England,</hi> and the Epitomie and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium of this great Volume of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state; To you who are assummoned by our King, and sent vp by our Country, to obay the first with your best Fidelities, to serue the second with your chiefeft zeale and endevours, and to affect and honour both, with your most religious prayers and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes. To you from whom God for his glory, our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne for his honor and safety, and our Church and Common-weale for their flourishing welfare and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,
<pb facs="3"/>
doe expect much by your transcendent and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable imploiments: To you I say, and to no other do I present this Consultation (termed <hi>Vox Coeli</hi>) to your consideration, and dedicate it to your protection.</p>
   <p>And because (in point of integritie and dutie) I hold my selfe bound to bring the truth neerer to your knowledge, or rather home to your vnderstanding; May it please you to be informed, that about some three yeares since, at the first setting of the last high Court of Parliament, when our King was so earnest in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the match of our Noble Prince his Sonne, with the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi>; When the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> coulourably pretended (though not really intended) to be deepely affected to entertaine and embrace the said motion; When Count <hi>Gondomar</hi> (his Ambassador) made shew to be a zealous solicitor, and a most actiue and officious stickler for compassing and finishing it; When our Romish Catholiques became passionately and insultingly confident of the free toleration of their Religion, and in the skie-reaching mountaines of their ambitious and superstitious hopes, were already prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, to erect their Groves and Altars, to set vp their Idols and Images, and consequently to introduce their Pope and his Masse in the Temples of our God; when all Prisons were vnlocked, and open to all pernitious Priests and dangerous Iesuites, and that many others
<pb facs="3"/>
like (Caterpillers and Vipers) came flocking and swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from diuers parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> to poyson and eate out the soules of our people, with their Idolatrous do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Antichrist, and to withdraw their hearts and consciences from their Alleagiance and Fidelity, to their naturall Prince &amp; Countrey; purposely (with more treachery then Religion) to subiect them to a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine power &amp; iurisdiction. When the Emperour had beaten the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> from <hi>Prague,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> with the assistance of the Swords, Souldiers, and Treasure of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> had in a setled truce assaulted and taken many Towns in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> contrary to their promises to our King, &amp; of his Maiesties to the Prince his Sonne in Law, and contrary to the publique peace of <hi>Germany</hi> and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome. Then, then it was, (that to pull off the Maske of <hi>Spaines</hi> ambition and malice, who with the fire of this match, sought to set <hi>England</hi> all fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in a mournefull and miserable combustion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to bury her glory in the dust, and her safety in the cinders of her subuersion and ruines) that as <hi>Prome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus</hi> fetch'd fire from heauen, so the fire of my zeale to the good of my Prince &amp; Countrey, likewise fetch'd from thence this Royall consultation for the discovery of our apprant and imminent dangers, and in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, to know likewise how to prevent them;
<pb facs="4"/>
Which resolving to make publique, because it is solely tended to <hi>Englands</hi> publique glory and prosperity: I contrary to my expectation (but not to my feares,) saw my hopes nipt in their blossomes, and my desires stifled in their births, because the Seas of our Kings affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Spaine</hi> went so lofty, and the windes were so tempestuous, that it could not possibly be permitted to passe the Pikes of the Presse: When albeit my zeale and fidelity againe and againe infused new audacity and courage to my resolutions, to see it salute the light, yet it was impossible for me or it to be made so happy, because I saw <hi>Allureds</hi> honest Letter, <hi>Scots</hi> loyall <hi>Vox Popoli, D. Whiting, D. Everad,</hi> &amp; <hi>Claytons</hi> zealous Sermons, and others, suppress'd and silenced, as also <hi>Wards</hi> faithfull picture, which yet was so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, as it onely breathed forth his fidelity to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in silent Rethorique, and dumbe eloquence. Whervpon inforced to take a law from the iniquity of the time, (with much reluctation and more griefe) I hushed vp my said Consultation in silence, and because I could not serve my Prince and Country in that booke of mine: I therefore then renewed my constant resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and zeale to serue them in my most fervent pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and my most religious and zealous wishes, the which I haue ever since faithfully and constantly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
   <p>
      <pb facs="4"/>Sitting thus to behold the constant inconstancie of the World, which presents as many different accidents to our knowledge, as obiects to our eye; and being iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, vigilant, and attentive, to that which did, or which might any way appertaine to my Soveraigne and his Princely posterity to his Dominions and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects; I was enforced to see (O that I had beene so happy as not to haue seen) the perfidious Progresse of <hi>Spaines</hi> new treacheries, and vsurpation vpon many Countries of <hi>Europe</hi>; For first, his Cousine <hi>Leopal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> hath devoured the Dutchy of <hi>Cleaves</hi> and <hi>Iulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi> then he and his forces have taken many other fre Townes, and whole Bishopricks in the Counties of <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> and La <hi>Marcke</hi>; as also in the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of <hi>Swisserland</hi> and <hi>Loraine:</hi> then he and his Factor the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> (for him) hath finished his absolute Conquest of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> (that dainty, rich and fertile Prouince of <hi>Germany</hi>) the Dowry of our onely Princesse, the inheritance of the Prince her Husband, and the Patrimony of their Royall issue, wherein the honour of our King, and of his three fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Kingdomes, doe most extreamely suffer.</p>
   <p>I saw him conquer the cheifest Cities, Forts, and Passages of the Grisons, and hath brought their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and liues to their last gaspe and periode; yea, to the mercilesse mercy of his not generous but bloody
<pb facs="5"/>
sword; which being vnder the protection of the French King, doth likewise cast a wonderfull staine and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish on the lustre of his honor and Crowne, if he spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily take not his revenge thereof; by leauing these his honest Confederates as free as he found them, and as great <hi>Henry</hi> his Father left them. And after the triumphes and treacherous progression of the house of <hi>Austria</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi> The King of <hi>Spaine</hi> hath now made a body of his, and the Imperiall forces, and this Summer intends to play his bloody prize for the totall ruine and subversion of the Netherlands; who (to the eye of the world, and to humane iudgement) must shortly sink, if the two Kings of great <hi>Brittaine</hi> and <hi>France</hi> doe not make them swim; by speedily sending them braue succours and assistance in this their vrgent necessitie.</p>
   <p>And whereunto tends all this treacherous ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and formidable vsurpation and greatnesse of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> but to cut out a passage with his sword, and to make his troopes and regiments flye o're the Alpes, for his erecting and obtaining of the West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erne Empire? And whereunto tends it I say, but to make his territories and Dominions to encirculize great <hi>Brittaine</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> yea to be their Cloyster, and to make and esteeme those two famous Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, but onely as a fatall Church-yard to burie
<pb facs="5"/>
and interre themselues in.</p>
   <p>But Illustrious and generous Sirs, is this all the malice and treachery which <hi>Spaine</hi> hath offered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>England?</hi> O no, nothing lesse; for vpon that iourney (which was as dangerous as suddaine) of our Prince into <hi>Spaine</hi> (then whom the world hath not a braver:) Hath not the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> dealt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherously with him about his match with the <hi>Infanta</hi> his Sister? yea have they not in his Princely person, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated the Lawes of Hospitality, and the Priviledges of Princes (when being vnder his own roofe) by attemp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting to tye him to formes, which were diametrally op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to his honour; yea, to be so audaciously impudent, as with much violency and virulency to seeke to put a rape vpon his Conscience and Religion, in their profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red enforcement of his Conversiō to Popery; as if their <hi>Infanta</hi> had bin to him more precious then his soule, or that he had beene so wretchedly grounded and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in pietie, that his Highnesse would haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken his God, purposely to haue obayed and adored the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> who is not, nor cannot be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter King then he is a Prince?</p>
   <p>And to step yet a degree farther; was it not a hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish policie, and a diabolicall designe and resolution of the Councell of <hi>Spaine,</hi> to advise our Prince vpon his return into <hi>England,</hi> to warre vpon the Protestants;
<pb facs="6"/>
and to proffer him an Army to suppresse and extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate them. The Protestants, I say, who are those by whom our King his Father raigneth, and without whom his Maiestie can never subsist nor raigne; nor his highnesse successively aspire, or hope to aspire to his Crownes and kingdomes after him, sith they are the life, the vigour, the heart, and the soule thereof. And will our King, and our Prince, our Parliaments and our Protestants of <hi>England,</hi> then ever forget this inveterate rage, and infernal malice of <hi>Spain</hi> against them? as also the rest of their imperious and insulting cariage towards his Highnes and towards great <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> as if they priz'd it at so low a rate, and made their boundles ambition so excessively over-value their own <hi>Spain?</hi> that that were in the <hi>Crisis</hi> of her weakenes and misery, and this in the prime &amp; verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call point of her power and glory? And when his High<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes pressed them for the restitution of the <hi>Palatinat,</hi> which they had oftē promised to the King his Father, then they temporized so cunningly, and subtillized so treacherously with him, that every day brought forth new delayes and difficulties, till in the end they had made the cure worse then the disease, &amp; having taken firm footing therein, were enforced to vnvaile &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask their dissimulation, and faintly and coldly to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that they would treate with the Emperour for
<pb facs="6"/>
the restitution thereof, but could not promise it: Thus having abused, first our King the Father, and then our Prince the Sonne, they have now likewise betrayed and ruined our Princesse the Daughter in their final Conquest, and resolute detention of the Prince her Husbands <hi>Palatinate,</hi> that Princesse I say, whose royal and sublime vertues, make her the honour of her time, the ornament of her sexe, and the Phaenix Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of the world. VVhereunto adding the absolute breach of the Match long since prophetically dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated, and cast in Heaven by the Princely and Royall Authors of this Consultation, and since the same breach here on earth likewise so happily confirmd by the King, as also by the Prince: so all these premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses considered▪ hath not <hi>Englād</hi> reason to hate <hi>Spain,</hi> in regard <hi>Spaine</hi> hates it? especially because of these two main ensuing points, &amp; important considerations?</p>
   <p>First, for that the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> is a greater &amp; more professed Enemy to our sacred King &amp; his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all posteritie, then either the Emperour, or Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and is so to be held and esteemed of vs.</p>
   <p>Secondly, that therefore to denounce warre to him, and to make it good as soone as it is denounced, is as Honourable as necessary, and as iust as honorable for <hi>England;</hi> As vpon New yeares day last I made these two points apparent and manifest to the King; in my Discourse intituled <hi>Votivae Angliae,</hi> which I sent
<pb facs="7"/>
his Maiestie in the behalfe and favour of the Prince <hi>Palatine</hi> his sonne in law, for the restoration of his <hi>Palatinate.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Hauing thus (with as much disdaine as griefe) seene his inveterate malice towards great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> towards our King and his Royall posterity, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the eminent danger wherinto our profound se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity hath throwne &amp; precipitated vs in particular; and vnderstanding likewise how the said King of <hi>Spaine</hi> with <hi>Xerxes,</hi> threatens the Seas and Mountaines of <hi>Europe</hi> in generall; Being as well in heart as tongue an Englishman, and therefore knowing by Grace, what I owe by Nature to my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Prince and Countrey (like <hi>Cressus</hi> his dumbe sonne) I would not, I could not be sil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>nt thereat, but must expose this Consultation of <hi>Vox Coeli</hi> to the light and sight of the world; I meane to the light of your knowledge, and the sight of your consideration, vnder the secure Target, and safe shelter and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary of your auspicious protection.</p>
   <p>To you therefore great <hi>Brittaines</hi> greatest Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines and Champions; to you the invincible Bulwarke of our King and his Royall progenie, and the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnable Cittadell and <hi>Acrocorinth</hi> of our Estate: To you I say the conscript Fathers of our supreamest Senate, doth it in duty present it selfe, and in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb facs="7"/>
prostrate it selfe; which when your first leisure hath curiously read, and your best zeale carefully and maturely considered: Then by all that true English blood which streameth in your heart &amp; veines, by all the love which your Country beares you, and by all the duty and affection which reciprocally you owe to your Country; I both request and coniure you, To tell our King that it is nothing for his Maiestie to haue made a braue and generous Declaration of warres against <hi>Spaine,</hi> except he speedily second it with execution, without which it will proue a vaine <hi>Fantasma,</hi> and an abortiue <hi>Embrion:</hi> Tell him, that it were the last Acts of <hi>Augustus,</hi> which embellished his raigne, and that old <hi>Pericles</hi> made the greatnes of his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity and courage, to revive &amp; flourish on his Tomb, when hee caused the <hi>Athenians</hi> to warre vpon the <hi>Pelopenessians:</hi> Tell him that <hi>Philopaemenus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, that peace is the best time to meditate of war. Tell him that to transport warre into <hi>Spaine,</hi> is to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voide and prevent it in <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Hannibal</hi> said to King <hi>Antiochus,</hi> that the only way to make warre against the Romanes, was to begin it in the heart and bowels of the Dominions of <hi>Rome,</hi> and so to vanquish <hi>Italy</hi> by <hi>Italy.</hi> Tell him that <hi>Plutarch</hi> affirmes, there is no Action so royall or magnificent in a King, as to take Armes to assist and revenge his
<pb facs="8"/>
Confederats vniustly oppressed and ruined, much more his owne Royall children, and that if the <hi>Palatinate</hi> be too farre, that <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Brabant,</hi> are hut the skirts and Suburbs of <hi>England.</hi> Tell him that <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silaus</hi> said, that words are feminine, and deedes Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine, and that it is a great point of honor, discretion, and happinesse for a Prince, to giue the first blowe to his Enemyes. Tell him that Spaniards hate vs; why then should we love them? that we can beate them at our pleasures, why then should we feare them? Tell him that if it goes not well with <hi>Holland,</hi> it must needes goe ill with <hi>England</hi>; and that if wee doe not preuent their ruine, that we cannot secure our owne danger. Tell him that in matters of warre, it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to make a stand, shamefull to retire, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to advance. Tell him that <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> is of <hi>Pirrhus</hi> his minde, who said, that having devoured and conquered all <hi>Europe,</hi> he would end his dayes in iolity and pleasure in <hi>Macedonia.</hi> And therefore that it is time, yea high time to strike vp our Drums against him, because as well our safety, as our Honour envites vs to it.</p>
   <p>And now turning from his Maiestie, to you the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious and famous body of this great and famous Court of Parliament, (whereof the King is the head) to you, I say, who are the creame and flower of his
<pb facs="8"/>
Subiects: O hold it no disparagement that I tell you, That sith in all matters of Order, Policie and Reformation, that delayes and protractions prove still dangerous, many times fatall; That you beware least as your Consultations flie away with the time, that occasion and opportunity flie not away with your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultations, sith Time must be taken by his fore-locke, and then as <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> saith, we haue winde and tide with vs.</p>
   <p>Thinke what a happinesse, what a glory it is for <hi>England</hi> to haue wars with <hi>Spaine,</hi> sith <hi>Spaine</hi> in the Lethargy of our peace, hath very neer vndermined our safety▪ and subverted our glory; And let vs dispell those charmes of security, wherein <hi>England</hi> hath bin too long lull'd and enchanted asleepe: And if feare and pusilanimity yet offer to shut our eies against our safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet let our resolution and courage open them to the imminency of our danger; that our glory may surmount our shame, and our swords cut those tongues and pens in pieces, which henceforth dare either to speake of peace, or write of truce with <hi>Spaine.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>No, no; to take the length of <hi>Spaines</hi> foote aright, we must doe it with our swords, not with our neckes, for the first wil assuredly establish our safety, and the second infalibly ruines. VVarres, warres, then yee (with cheerfull hearts and ioyfull soules) let vs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<pb facs="9"/>
our selues for warres: That our great <hi>Brittaine</hi> the beauty of <hi>Europe,</hi> as <hi>Europe</hi> is the glory of the world) lie no longer exposed to the apparant danger and mercilesse mercy of this Castillian Rat, of this Crocodile of <hi>Italy,</hi> of this Vulture of <hi>Germany,</hi> &amp; of this wolfe of <hi>Ardena;</hi> but let vs all signalize our fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to our Soveraigne by our courage, and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize our zeale to our Country by our valour and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution herein· That we may all be of <hi>Alcibiades</hi> his opinion, that the bed of Honour is the best death, that there is no better recompence of death then glory, nor no richer glory, then to die for our Prince &amp; Country.</p>
   <p>And here I had imposed silence to my pen, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused a period to this my Epistle, had not the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of your places, the qualitie of your imployments, the nature of the time, and the consideration that I am an Englishman, commanded me to insert and anex these few lines, by the way either of a Supplement, or a Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script.</p>
   <p>Although I can adde nothing to your affection and care, for the good of our Countrey, yet give me leave (I beseech you) to substract from this mine owne fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and zeale.</p>
   <p n="1">
