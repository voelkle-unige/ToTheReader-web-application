   <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Ruth it is, that this ensuing Treatise was long since in my younger yeares begunne by me for mine owne private exercise and satisfaction, but afterward considering not onely the rarity of the subject, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of the matter, but withall that it made for the <hi>redeeming of a captivated truth,</hi> the <hi>vindicating of Gods glory,</hi> the <hi>advancement of learning, &amp; the honour of the Christian &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion,</hi> by the advise and with the approbation and incouragement of such speciall friends, whose piety, learning, and wisedome I well know, and much reverence, I resolved <hi>(permissu superiorum</hi> and none other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise) to make it publique for the publique good, and the encountring of a publique errour, which may in some sort be equalled, if not prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the quelling of some great monster. Neither doe I take it to lye out of my <hi>profession,</hi> the principall marke which I ayme at throughout the whole body of the Discourse, being an <hi>Apologeticall defence of the power &amp; providence of God,</hi> his <hi>wisedome,</hi> his <hi>truth,</hi> his <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, his goodnes</hi> &amp; <hi>mercy,</hi> and besides, a great part of the booke it selfe is spent in pressing <hi>Theologicall</hi> reasons, in clearing doubts arising from thence, in producing frequent testimonies from <hi>Scriptures, Fathers, Schoolemen,</hi> and <hi>moderne Divines,</hi> in proving that <hi>Antichrist</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come from the writings of the <hi>Romanists</hi> themselues, in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the article of our faith touching the Worlds future and totall consummation by fire, and a day of finall judgement from discourse of reason and the writings of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and lastly by concluding the whole worke with a pious <hi>meditation</hi> touching the vses which we may and should make of the consideration thereof, seruing for a terrour to some, for comfort to others, for admonition to all And how other men may stand affected in reading, I know not, sure I am that in writing, it often lifted vp my soule in admiring and praysing the infinite <hi>wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> and <hi>bounty</hi> of the <hi>Crator</hi> in maintaining and managing his owne worke, in the gouernment and preservation of the <hi>Vniverse,</hi> which in
<pb facs="6"/>
truth is nothing else but (as the Schooles speake) <hi>continuata productio,</hi> a continuated production: &amp; often did it call to my mind those holy rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the <hi>Psalmist; O Lord our governour, how excellent is thy Name in all the world? Thou Lord hast made me glad through thy workes, &amp; I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce</hi>
      <note place="margin">Psal. 8. 1. Psal. 92. 4. 5. 6.</note>
      <hi>in giuing praise for the operations of thy hands, O Lord, how glorious are thy workes, &amp; thy thoughts are very deepe. An vnwise man doth not well consider this, &amp; a foole doth not well vnderstand it.</hi> And againe, <hi>The</hi>
      <note place="margin">111. 2. 3.</note>
      <hi>workes of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that haue pleasure therein, His worke is worthy to be praised &amp; had in honour, &amp; his righteousnes endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for euer.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And though whiles I haue laboured to free the world from old age, I feele it creeping vpon my selfe, yet if it shall so please the same great and gratious Lord, I intend by his assistance spating mee life &amp; health hereafter to write Another <hi>Apologie of his power &amp; providence in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his Church,</hi> which perchaunce by some may be thought both more proper for mee, and for these times more necessary, though he that shall narrowly obserue the prints of the <hi>Almighties</hi> footsteppes, traced throughout this ensuing discourse, may not vnjustly from thence collect, both comfort and assurance, that as the Heauens remaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, so doth the Church triumphant in Heauen, &amp; as all things vnder the cope of heauen vary and change, so doth the militant heere on earth; it hath its times and turnes, sometimes flowing and againe eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing with the <hi>sea,</hi> sometimes waxing, and againe waning with the <hi>Moone,</hi> which great light, it seemes, the <hi>Almighty</hi> therefore set the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est in the heavens, and nearest the Earth, that it might dayly put vs in minde of the constancy of the one, and inconstancy of the other, her selfe in some sort partaking of both, though in a different manner; of the one in her substance, of the other in her visage.</p>
   <p>And if the <hi>Moone</hi> thus change, and all things vnder the <hi>Moone,</hi> why should we wonder at the chaunge of <hi>Monarchies</hi> and <hi>Kingdomes?</hi> much lesse petty states and private families: they rise, and fall, and rise again, and fall againe, that no man might either too confidently presume, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are subject to continuall alteration, or cast away all hope, and fall to despaire, because they haue their seasons and appointed times of returning againe.</p>

   <p>I must confesse that sometimes looking stedfastly vpon the present
<pb facs="6"/>
face of things both at home and abroad, I haue beene often put to a stand, and staggered in mine opinion, whither I were in the right or no; and perchaunce the state of my body, and present condition, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of those faire hopes I sometimes had, served as false perspectiue glasses to looke through, but when againe I abstracted and raised my thoughts to an higher pitch, and as from a vantage ground tooke a larger view, comparing time with time, and thing with thing, and place with place, and considered my selfe as a member of the <hi>Vniverse,</hi> and a <hi>Citizen of the World,</hi> I found that what was lost to one part, was gained to another; and what was lost in one time, was to the same part recouered in another; and so the ballance by the divine providence over-ruling all, kept vpright. But comon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it fares with men in this case, as with one who lookes onely vpon some libbet, or end of a peece of <hi>Arras,</hi> he happily conceiues an hand or head which he sees, to be very vnartificially made; but vnfolding the whole, soone findes that it carries a due and just proportion to the body; so, <hi>qui de pauca resp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

      <hi>for the best to them that loue God:</hi> and that though some members suffer, yet the whole is no way thereby indammaged at any time; and at other times those same members are againe relieued, as the Sunne when it sets to vs, it rises to our <hi>Antipodes,</hi> and when it remooues from the <hi>Northerne</hi> parts of the world, it cherishes the <hi>Southerne,</hi> yet stayes not there, but returnes againe with his comfortable beames to those very parts which for a time it seemed to haue forsaken: <hi>O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodnesse, and declare the wonders that he hath done for the children of men!</hi> or at leastwise cry out in admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the <hi>Apostle, O the depth of the riches both of the wisdome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>

   </p>
   <p>Yet the next way, in some measure to finde them out, (so farre as is possible for vs poore wormes heere crawling in a mist vpon the face of the Earth) is, next the sacred Oracles of supernatutall and revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Truth; to study the great Volume of the <hi>Creature,</hi> and the <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> not onely of our owne, but of forraigne Countreyes, and those not onely of the present, but more auncient times. <hi>Enquire I pray thee of the former age, and prepare thy selfe to the search of their Fathers, for wee</hi>

I haue called in subsidiary aydes, from <hi>Philosophers, Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, Mathematitians, Grammarians, Logicians, Poets, Oratours, Souldiers, Travellers, Lawyers, Physitians,</hi> and if I haue in imitation of <hi>Tertullian, Cyprian, Eusebius, Augustine, Lactantius, Arnobius, Minutius,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to cut the throates of the <hi>Paynims</hi> with their owne swords, and pierced them with their owne quills, I hope no learned man, or louer of Learning will censure me for this. <hi>Philosophie</hi> and the <hi>Arts</hi> I must account a part of mine owne profession; and for <hi>Physicke</hi> and the <hi>Lawes,</hi> I haue therein consulted the chiefe, as well in this <hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,</hi> as out of it, of mine owne acquaintance; nay in <hi>History,</hi> the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematiques</hi> and <hi>Divinity</hi> it selfe, I haue not onely had the approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the publique professours therein; for the maine points in my booke, which concerne their severall professions, but some peeces I must acknowledge as receiued from them, which I haue made bold to insert into the body of my discourse; let no man think then that I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a paradoxe for ostentation of wit, or haue written out of spleene, to gall any man in particular, nor yet to humour the present times; the times themselues, mine indisposition that way, and resolution to sit downe content with my present fortunes; if they serue not to giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers satisfaction therein, yet doe they fully to cleare mee to my selfe, from any such aspersion: yet thus much, I hope, I safely may say without suspition of flattery, that by the goodnesse of GOD, and our gratious Soveraigne vnder GOD, wee yet enjoy many great bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings which former ages did not, and were wee thankfull for these as we ought, and truely penitent for our excesse in all kinde of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous sinnes (which aboue all, threatens our ruine) I nothing doubt but vpon our returne to our God by humiliation and newnesse of life, he would soone dissolue the cloud which hangs ouer vs, and returne vnto vs with the comfortable beames of his favour, and make vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne each to other with mutuall imbracements of affection and due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and our Armies and Fleetes to returne with spoyle and victory, and reduce againe as golden and happy times, as euer wee or our fore-fathers saw: but if we still goe on with an high hand, and a stiffe necke in our prophanesse, our pride, our luxury, our vncharitablenesse, our vnnaturall divisions in Church and Common-wealth, there needes no <hi>propheticall</hi> spirit to divine what will shortly become of vs; <hi>Turne vs; O turne vs againe O Lord God of hostes, shew the light of thy Countenance and wee shall bee whole;</hi> shew the light of thy Countenance and wee shall be provident in counsell, successefull in warre, sober in peace, a terrour to our enemies, and a comfort to our allies and confederates. <hi>Turne thee againe thou God of hostes, looke downe from heaven, behold &amp; visite this vine and the place of the vineyard that thy right hand hath planted: and the branch that thon madest so strong for thy selfe.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>We need goe no farther then the nation of the <hi>Iewes</hi> for a notable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in this kinde; who at times more zealous then they in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God &amp; the exercises of Religion? and who againe at other times more rebellious?

      <hi>they his words;</hi> but presently it followes in the very next verse, <hi>they soone forgot his works:</hi> &amp; according to their obedience or rebelliō, so were they either prosperous or vnfortunate in the course of their affaires; during their faith &amp; fidelity towards God, every man of them was in warre as a thousand strong, &amp; as much as a great Senate for counsel in peaceable deliberations; contrarywise, if they swerued (as often they did) their wonted courage and magnanimity forsooke them vtterly; their souldiers and military men trembled at the sight of the naked sword; when they entred into mutuall conference, and sate in counsell for their owne good; that which children might haue seene, their gravest Senatou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1+ letters">

   <p>If then wee come short of that courage and valour, which made our Auncestours so renowned by sea and land, not onely in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> but in <hi>Palaestina</hi> it selfe; sure it is not, because the <hi>World declines,</hi> but because our <hi>luxury</hi> increases, the most evident <hi>symptome</hi> of a declining state; for as all <hi>Empires</hi> haue risen to their greatnesse by <hi>vertue,</hi> and specially by <hi>sobrietie</hi> and <hi>frugalitie;</hi> so is it cleare that by vice, and specially by <hi>luxury,</hi> which of necessity drawes on softnes and cowardise) they haue all againe declined and come to nothing; and out of their ashes haue others sprung vp, which likewise within a while (such a <hi>circulation</hi> there is in all things) haue bin turned into ashes againe.</p>

   <p>We wonder (as well wee may) at <hi>Aristotles</hi> wit expressed in his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous workes, but his indefatigable paines in study, we consider not, holding in his hand when he layde him downe to rest, a ball of brasse, which as soone as sleepe overtooke him, fell into a basin of brasse, purposely set vnder, that so being awakened with the noyse thereof, he might againe returne to his booke▪ and though he were, as witnesseth <hi>Censorinus,</hi> of so crasie a body, (that it is more strange hee should liue to his <hi>Climactericall</hi> yeare, then that he then died) yet by the
<pb facs="8"/>
invincible strength of his minde, did he wade through a world of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, and hath thereby left such fruites thereof to the world, as hath deservedly wonne him immortall honour. <hi>Seneca</hi> a man of an admirable vivacity of spirit, writes of himselfe, that one day he heard <note place="margin">Epist. 108.</note>

But to come neerer home, King <hi>Alfred</hi> thought to be founder or restorer of the Vniversity of <hi>Oxford</hi> is reported to haue cast the naturall day, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of 24 houres, into three parts; whereof the one he spent in affaires of state, a second in the service of his body, and the residue in prayer, study, and writing, which spaces of time, hauing then none other engine for that purpose, he measured by a great waxe light divided into so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts, receiving notice by the keeper thereof, as the seuerall houres passed in burning.</p>

selues, not <hi>Nature,</hi> or rather God vnder that name. And yet what the bodies of men euen in these latter ages being throughly put to it, are able to endure, the extant workes of <hi>Tostatus, Erasmus, Gesner, Calvin, Luther, Baronius, Bellarmine,</hi> and others sufficiently testifie; it is to this effect a true speech of <hi>Arnoldus Clapmarus</hi> in his <hi>nobile trienni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, incredibile est quantum brevissimo tempore humana possit assequi in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustria,</hi> it is incredible what the industry of man in a very short time may attaine vnto.
