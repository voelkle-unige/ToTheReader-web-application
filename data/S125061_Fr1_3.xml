   <head>To the Courteous Reader.</head>
   <p>BEnevolent Reader, I doe here present thee with this small worke, hoping it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce good effects. Certainly it hath assayed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore time to thrust it selfe into the world, but that it found so kind friends, who considering the unworthinesse, were pleased to suppresse it and keepe it prisoner in the goale of their owne houses. Howbeit now it is adventured abroad, and with the spring beginneth to spring afresh. Its winters imprisonment is likely to better its summers condicions, for I have laboured so far as I could to prune and loppe off the former er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, that so it may be the more plausible. I have also adorned it with a new weed, to wit of a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, or questions and answers, that so my booke may even learne to stoupe to the weakest capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. If it shall be thought to come in a new fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may you please to looke into the world, you may see abundance in this habit, our common Catechismes weare this gowne; yea, Mr. <hi>St: Egerton</hi> of the <hi>Blacke Friers</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> hath contracted the seven treatises of Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> into this forme. For my part, I hold it more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
<pb facs="4"/>then the former tract, neither greatly preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to the Author.</p>
   <p>This adorned, I have given this my second sonne, full libertie to be a free-man, banishing my first and worst labours, from the view (so farre as I can) of all men. For seeing it would not, when I would, I hold it not fit, that now it should be published. Touching that worke, it slowed so inconsiderately from my penne, and slipped so rashly out of my hand, that it escaped not without many defaultes, imperfections, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurities &amp; blemishes: that with the Egyptian Grashopper, it will not onely consume some part, but utterly eate up and waste the golden season and happie houres of the courteous reader. Let this last worke then kind reader finde favour in thine eyes; if that winter bird should be seene, it would appeare like a Cuckoe at Christmas, or like the Oule which is the admiration of other birds. I will onely now shew thee the causes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing this last worke, and the use thereof, and so leave it to thy discreet iudgement. The causes are manifold, first to stoppe the springing of that Abortiue forespoken off, that so it might not thrive to the discredit of its parent. Secondly that the gratuity and thankefulnesse to my Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle aforesaid might not be buried in oblivion, for <hi>tritum est perire quod facis ingrato.</hi> Thirdly, for the benefit as I said of the simplest capacitie.
<pb facs="4"/>And finally for the zeale I beare to mine owne country, being willing and desirous, that not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, but even women, should exercise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the study of the sacred artes.</p>
   <p>If any shall demande what benefit shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>downd hereby, or what may be the use hereof? I answere, it will availe greatly, not onely for ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill and morall discourse, but also for the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing of all errors, either in manners or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, for saith <hi>Ovid,</hi>
   </p>
   <p>
      <hi>Adde quod ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes emollit mores nec sinet esse feros.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But may some say, I live privatly, converse not in the world, what neede have I of this science? It seemeth to consist chiefly in disputing, but I imploy my selfe most in silence and meditation. Well friend, thou mayest have great benefit by this science, even in that likewise, an example of which, word for word, I have here produced out of Mr. <hi>Egertons</hi> treaty aforesaid, that so thou mightest know how to benefit thy selfe by this science even in thy meditation.</p>
   <p>What thing is this O my soule, that doth so besot thee? or what manner of thing may it bee, wherewith thou art so delighted, or rather bewitched, and how doth the Holy Ghost in the scriptures define it, and set it forth? who are sinners, but they that rebell against God, and against his holy will, revealed in his word?<note place="margin">Definiti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on.</note> and what other thing is sinne, but a breach &amp; trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
<pb facs="5"/>of the law of God, <hi>1 Iohn. 3.4.</hi> a tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out of the way of life, as the phrase of the old Testament doth import, and a swerving from the right marke and end, as the word useth in the new testament to signifie: viz. the glory of God and thine owne salvation. This cursed thing called sinne, is not of one sort or kind; it is is a monster of many heads, and (as it were) a beast of many hornes. It is both originall, bred and borne with us, and actuall springing out of us from that venomous root of our originall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Againe, it is either inward lurking and boyling in the heart; or outward shewing it selfe in the life and conversation: sometimes it onely inhabiteth and dwelleth in us, and oft times it doth raigne and overrule us; sometimes it is but an error and infirmity, and sometimes it is a willfull and presumtuous evill, <hi>Psal. 19.11, 12.</hi> sometimes it is pardonable, by the free grace and mercy of God to them that truely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and repent; and sometimes it is utterly unpardonable and never to be forgiven, being such that it is impossible that the committers thereof should be renewed by repentance, <hi>Matth. 12. Heb. 6.</hi> Sometimes it rusheth mediately and directly against God, and sometimes it reacheth more properly to the hurt of our neighbour. But who is able to reckon up all the branches of this most bitter and venomous tree, wherefore (to
<pb facs="5"/>looke more nearely unto it) whence proceedeth this deadly poyson,<note place="margin">Cause Efici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</note> what may be the cause where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it commeth, and the fountaine from whence it springeth? Surely my soule, it is even thy selfe: thou art the roote that bringeth forth all this bitternesse, thou art the fountaine from whence all this deadly venome doth arise. For every man is tempted to sinne, and hee is drawne away of his owne concupisence, and enticed. Beware therefore O rebellius soule, that thou lay not the blame upon the Lord, neither make him the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of thy sinne: for thou O God as thou canst not be tempted to evill thy selfe, so thou temptest no man to commit sinne, being a thing which thou so straitly forbiddest to all, and so severely threatnest in whomsoever it is found, and for which thou so grieveously plaguest the wicked, and so sharpely correctest thine owne children, <hi>Iam. 1.13, 14. Heb 12.7, 8.</hi> Thou O Lord art holinesse it selfe and the fountaine thereof, and there is none eternally, and unchangably good but thee alone, <hi>Mat. 19.</hi> Thou madest man good at the beginning, but he sought many inventions <hi>Eccles. 12.</hi> so all the imaginations &amp; thoughts f his heart be came onely evill continually, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, sabboth and all, <hi>Gen. 6.5.</hi> True it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that the Divell that old Dragon using the subtle serpent for his instrument, did offer the first occasion of sinning, wherby he became an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<pb facs="6"/>cause of sinne, and is called a murtherer from the beginning, and the author and father of all deceit, <hi>Iohn 8.44.</hi> yet man had power to have resisted him if he would, which he not doing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the true &amp; proper efficient cause of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himself, &amp; all his posterity, who likewise by meanes of the poyson derived from his loynes, became also the proper and immediate causes of their own sinnes. Marke well then (O my soule) the roote of this evill, and further consider, what unsavory &amp; cursed fruit it bringeth forth; sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly even such as it selfe is,<note place="margin">The fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Cause, or the end or fruit of sinne.</note> for such as the tree is, such are the fruites: as is the roote, so are the branches; a poysoned fountaine casteth forth no wholesome streames, <hi>Iam. 3.</hi> and who can bring (as the wiseman saith) a cleane thing out of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse? surely there is not one, but onely hee who is holinesse it selfe, <hi>Iohn 14.4.</hi> And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all controversie, the reward and wages of sin is death, and that not onely temporall and bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which is a separation of the body from the soule for a season, but also spirituall and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall both of soule and body for ever and ever. Is any good thing withheld from us? let us thanke our sin for it: is any plague or punishment laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us? be sure that sinne is the cause, or at the least (even in the dearest children of God) the occasion of it. Is any good blessing of God made of no force, or even turned to a curse to us? wee
<pb facs="6"/>may be sure that it is by reason of our sin: for (as the Prophet saith) the Lords hand is not short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that it cannot save, nor his eare heavie that it cannot heare, but our iniquities seperate betwixt us and our God, and our sinnes doe hide his face from us that he will not heare, <hi>Esay 59.1, 2.</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally (as <hi>Iob</hi> saith) <hi>miserie springeth not forth out of the dust, neither doth affliction spring out of the earth, but man is borne to labour as the sparkles fly upward, Iob 5.6, 7.</hi> As if he should say, man is as prone by nature to sinne against God, &amp; consequently to pull Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon him selfe, as the fire (which is a light element) is naturally prone to ascend and mount aloft. And to the end that thou (my soule) maist see upon what an ugly monster thou hast set thy delight, dost dote upon,<note place="margin">The o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>
         <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>posites &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>traries</note> and art bewitched withall, consider how faire and amiable pietie and vertue are, for as they make a man lovely and honorable, so sinne maketh him loath some and contemptible: <hi>The feare of God</hi> (saith <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>) <hi>makes the face of a man to shine and be beautiful,</hi> but impiety and prophanesse do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face and disfigure the image of God in him, and cause both God and all good men to loath and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test him as a polluted and filthy thing, <hi>Favour</hi> (saith the same <hi>Wise-man</hi>) <hi>is deceitfull, and beauty is vanity, but the woman that feareth the Lord, shee shall be praysed, Prov. 31.39.</hi> A
<pb facs="7"/>
      <hi>vile person is contemned</hi> (that is, a prophane man and basely esteemed how great soever he be in the world) <hi>in the eyes of him that feareth God, Psal. 15.4.</hi> And pietie is the onely beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that the Lord himselfe is delighted with, <hi>1 Pet. 3.4.</hi> Therefore it is cleare in the contrary part, that hee loatheth and abhorreth impietie and sinne,<note place="margin">Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> and yet my soule to bring thee further out of love with this most ugly monster, consider whereunto it is like and to what it may be compared. It is like (saith <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say</hi>) to filthy raggs, that are cast aside upon the dunghill, and detested of al the passers by. It bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth as a serpent and stingeth as a Coccatrice, creepeth as a gangrene or deadly canker, that eateth to the heart and cannot bee cured; and though it seeme sweete in the beginning, yet it is most bitter in the end, and that which relisheth like hony in the mouth, will prove ranke poyson in the bowels.<note place="margin">Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</note> Finally O my soule if thou peruse the holy Scriptures, thou shalt find no booke, no leafe, no chapter, no scarce any verse, wherein there is not some precept, some prohibition, some promise, some threatning, or some example which seemeth not very fitly &amp; profitably to shew forth the amiablenesse of vertue, and the uglinesse of sinne, &amp; with what care, zeale, watchfulnesse, &amp;c, the one is to be shunned, and the other to bee imbraced. Thus farre Mr. <hi>Egerton,</hi> Lib. <hi>

   <p>Now that thou maist attaine kind reader unto this sweete delight of meditation, or to the top of whatsoever felicity thou aymest at by this art, use my booke in this manner follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
   <p>It consisting onely of rules and examples, will bee no great burthen for thee to commit it all to memorie, and so whether thou meditatest or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursest, of sinne or piety in the generall, or any vice or vertue in the particular, thou shalt finde from the head of this arte after the example foreshewed, abundance of matter to furnish thy meditation. So <hi>cum pacis sapientibus</hi> I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my labour to thy discreete and favourable construction, and with equall respect to all indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently rest.</p>
