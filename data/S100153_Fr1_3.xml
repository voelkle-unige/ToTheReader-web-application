                 <title>A plaine confutation of a treatise of Brovvnisme, published by some of that faction, entituled: A description of the visible Church : In the confutation wherof, is shewed, that the author hath neither described a true gouerment of the Church, nor yet proued, that outward discipline is the life of the Church. Whereunto is annexed an ansvvere vnto two other pamphlets, by the said factioners latelie dispersed, of certaine conferences had with some of them in prison. Wherein is made knowen the inconstancie of this sect, what the articles are which they still maintaine as also a short confutation of them. There is also added a short ansvvere vnto such argumentes as they haue vsed to proue the Church of England not to be the Church of God</title>

   <head>TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Owsoeuer earthly kingdoms do prosper best, when
peace is had, yet the church of Christ which is his
throne,<note place="margin">Cassi. in Psa. 1.</note> receiueth good euen by dissention, <hi>Inde
crescit Ecclesia, vnde mundus deficit.</hi> Therfore
although a good agreement in al affaires ought to be regarded,
yet a dissent in religion doth sometime profit, inasmuch as ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the faith of some is exercised, the inconstancie of others is
made manifest, and the diligence of all those whom deep securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
hath not ouerwhelmed, is much quickned vnto the serching
of the truth. The rent that is made by some, hath confirmed this
vnto vs by experience, whiles that the constancie of such as are
wise hearted, is made manifest; the vanitie of those that are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stedfastly
minded is laide open; &amp; the godly are made acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with those ancient heresies, whereof in times past they were
both ignorant and carelesse. The disturbances of our Church
are many, proceeding from one fountaine, though they bee not
all of one nature; Satan hath sent them, they are like vnto him,
disagreeing one with another, and at iarre in themselues, and yet
are all opposite vnto the truth. For the Atheists and Papists are
at as great defiance one with another, as euer was Herod and
Pilate.<note place="margin">Luk. 23. 12</note> And the Anabaptists and Donatists condemne each the
other for matters of religion, as much as the Pharesies did the
Saduces; and yet as they could bee reconciled,<note place="margin">Math. 22.</note> rather then the
Church should inioy her peace; so these will sooner iustifie one
another, than they will submit themselues vnto the truth. But
the bush which Msoses sawe perished not, though it was compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with a flame: and the Church of God through his gracious
prouidence doth stand fast, though the securitie of Atheists, the
Idolatrie of Papists, and the impietie of the rest, haue threatned
an ouerthrow: yea, it is now come to passe, that although no he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie
is without some fauourers, yet the deuises euen of the most
skilfull deceiuers, haue bene so laid vpon, that not one of those is
thought vpon of sober mindes, but with detestation. <hi>I</hi> grant that
men voide of reason may thinke reuerently of them, because wee
see the Donatist condemning Donatisme, a schisme which hee
himselfe vpholdeth, which is a verie dronkennes, though it bee
without wine;<note place="margin">Aug. contra Cresco. lib. 5</note> but wisedome is iustified of her children.</p>
   <p>The Donatists in the yeere of our Lorde 290. or as some
write 353. by their preposterous dealings disturbed the churches
in all those partes where they remained.<note place="margin">August. Bonif. Epist. 50.</note> With vaine impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
they condemned all the Churches of God,<note place="margin">Aug. ad quod vult deum, de haer. cat.</note> and affirmed that
the Church was in the partes of Donatus onely. Also in vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that the Church of Christ is without spot or wrinkle, or
<pb facs="4"/>
grosse pollution; they did falsely charge Coecilianus the Bishop
of Carthage with certaine crimes, taking occasion therevpon to
separate themselues from the Church; They did account the
Sacraments to be no Sacraments,<note place="margin">Aug. in Psa. 10. Retrac. lib. 1. cap. 21. Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riano. Epist. 21. Contra Epist. Parmeniani, lib. 1. cap 7 Aug. Donat. Epist. 204 Cont. Epist. Parmi. li. 1. ca. 7 Aug Epist. 152 Daneus de Donat. cap. 67. And by the councell are latine. August. contra Parmi. lib. 1. cap. 6</note> if they were deliuered by one
that approued not their schisme; And therevpon, though Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus
did not institute rebaptization, yet his successors rebapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
those that came vnto them. They taught that it was vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to seeke vnto the magistrate for aide in causes of the church,
because they were the Lords free people. To be short, that men
are not to be compelled vnto good duties, that they are to vow a
constancie in their schisme, that they were ready to prouoke
the sword of the magistrate against themselues, that they might
brag of sufferings: these and such like were the fruites of Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.
Now Donatus the first author of this schisme, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for an heretique, and his doctrine for hereticall, in the
daies of Constantine, by the councel of Carthage; and from time
to time euer since it hath ben so accounted of, not onely of the
Church of God, but also of such as abhorre the name, but main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the doctrine of this schisme.</p>
   <p>This is it that the malcontents of our age do greedilie hunt
after the annoiance of our church; condemne it and all other
Churches that are not partakers of their faction; crie out that
the true church is without spot or wrinkle, or grosse pollution,
take libertie to slaunder those that are in authoritie, so to free
themselues from all submission: affirme that the Sacraments are
no Sacraments. (Whervpon though the renuer of this schisme,
Browne I meane,<note place="margin">Some of their owne compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed it.</note> did not in plaine wordes require a baptising a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
yet their succossors in their established Church attempted
it) haue taught, that they being the Lordes free people, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
is not to deale in causes ecclesiasticall: holde that men
are not to be compelled to good duties, binde one another with
a vow to persist in this faction, boast of suffrings, &amp;c. &amp; yet detest
the name of Donatisme, though Donatus was the first deuiser, &amp;
of Brownisme, though Brown was the only restorer of these fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies.
The forerunners it should seeme, were grosse, when their
Disciples are ashamed to be accounted their schollers: yet if anie
grossenesse as yet vnnamed, either in matters of faith, or manner
of dealing be found in them, it will appeare in these also; for it is
no new fansie but an ancient heresie, neither is there hope that
they will be restrained but by an olde remedie: For as the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists
when councels were called conference was had, and they
were conuicted, yet gaue it out with great glorie, that they had
put to silence all the learned,<note place="margin">August. ret. li. 2 cap. 26. &amp; Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifacio. epi. 50</note> and remained wilfull, vntill that by
the sharp laws of Honorius, they were restrained, yea and many
of them by that meanes were brought againe to the Church: so
<pb facs="4"/>
with our men all gentle meanes haue bene vsed: in conference
hard speeches haue onelie helped them, yet remaine they obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
and brag of victorie: if the lawes of our christian Honorius
doe them no good, they are incurable. No doubt the Phisition is
irke some to a frantique person, and a father to an vnrulie child,
the one in binding, the other in striking, and both in louing. The
dutie of a phisition, and the nature of a father must appeare in
the magistrate, not in satisfieng the desires of the froward to cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
them, but in restraining their phrensie to profite them. It
may bee to the discontentment of some, that anie punishment
should be inflicted vpon them for their disordered stubburnnes,
<hi>I</hi> would not be mistaken,<note place="margin">In his confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with m. Cooper, pa. 49</note> I wish it not, howsoeuer m. Greenwood
affirmeth that the magistrate ought to compell vnto the hearing
of the word. Only this I saie, that the lesse these matters are cōsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
of, the better may the men be conceiued of, but view their
writings, examine their doctrine, and marke their dealings, and
they will appeare the open enemies of Gods truth: for in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to establish a church, they ouerthrowe the church, and
vnder the colour of setting vp the discipline of Christ, they seeke
to plague themselues and others with their owne dreams, which
in this their treatise of discipline, and in their two other treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
of certaine conferences lately by them published, shall bee
made manifest to the indifferent reader. In answering of them
al (onelie the calumniations in the conferences excepted, which
concerne some particular persons, whose cause I leaue to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
who best know how farre they are abused, and in regorde
thereof can best answere the same) I haue followed the authors
method, leauing the man, and seeing into the matter, not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
who wrote it, but what is the doctrine that is maintained by
him. As for the treatise of the visible Church, it will appeare not
tollerable, inasmuch as it is impious, abusing the Scripture, iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to the Church in describing a false gouernment, and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to the simple, who are readie to bee deceiued with euerie
blast of vaine doctrine. The other discourses are not onely like
vnto it, but haue in them many bitter speeches &amp; vngodlie slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
both of Church, Magistracie, Ministerie, and all: wherby it
seemeth that the author hath not learned to rule his pen. In this
mine attempt I haue small hope to satisfie those that are wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to their will, when Gaudentius was answered sufficientlie to
his follies, hee would notwithstanding returne his aunswere
though he did the same,<note place="margin">Aug. ret. lib. 2 cap. 59.</note>
      <hi>nulla ratione respondens, sed magis
se nec respondere, nec tacere potuisse declarans.</hi> If our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
wil replie, let him labour to be vnlike to Gaudentius and his
companie, who with words and bitter speeches sought to vphold
their cause, &amp; if he vse the Scriptures, let him applie them faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
<pb facs="5"/>
and then if he preuaile the controuersie will be at end. In
the meane while if these poore labours of mine might satisfie
these discontented persons; or failing hereof, might staie the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
from beeing seduced, or else might prouoke them that
are better able to deale more substantially in these matters, I shal
be glad. Finally, I am to intreate the reader both to accept in
good part that which in desire of his good is deliuered. And also
before hee beginne to reade this treatise, to amend such faultes
as by default in the printing were committed.</p>
