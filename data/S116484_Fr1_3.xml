   <head>To the Christian READER, <hi>Thomas Samson</hi> wisheth the felicity of speedy and full conuersion to the LORD.</head>
   <p>GOdly Learned men doe write &amp; publish bookes, to profit y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> age in which they liue, and the poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. This desire was in the Authour of this Treatise, M. <hi>Iohn Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> who preached &amp; published this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of Repentance. And now that we, which do liue after him, and are the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, may take as much or more profit by it, then they did for whom it was first preached &amp; published it is by new imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting published againe. Nothing is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to this Sermon, or altered in it: only to the Sermon of Repentance is added another Sermon of the Lords Supper, which he also made, and was neuer prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before. And aptly are they ioined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. For in perusing of the last, thou shalt see how necessarily he draweth the doctrine of Repentance to them al, which do with due preparation receiue the holy Sacrament of Christ. They are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="5"/>the most profitable Teachers, which haue good experience by practise in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, of that which they doe teach to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: such as may safely say; <hi>Brethren, be ye followers of me, &amp; look on them which walke so, as ye haue vs for an example, Phil. 3.17.</hi> And surely, such a patterne was M. <hi>Bradford</hi> in his life time, of this doctrine of Repentance: for I knew him familiarly, and must needes giue to God this prayse for him, that (among men) I haue scarce knowne one like vnto him. I did know when, and partly how it pleased God, by effectuall calling to turne his heart vnto the true knowledge, and obedience of the most holy Gospell of Christ our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. Of which God did giue him such an heauenly hold and liuely feeling, that as he did then know, that many sinnes were forgiuen him, so surely hee declared by deeds that he loued much. For where he had doth giftes and calling, to haue em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed himselfe in ciuill and worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires profitably; such was his loue of Christ, and zeale to the promoting of his glorious Gospel, that after that God had touched his heart, he changed, not onely the course of his former life, as the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man did, <hi>Luke 7.</hi> but euen his profession and former study, as <hi>Paul</hi> did.</p>
   <p>Touching the first, hee presently sold his Chaynes, Rings, Brooches, &amp; Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of gold, which before he vsed to weare,
<pb facs="6"/>and did bestow the price of this his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer vanity, in the necessary reliefe of Christs poore members, which he could heare of, or finde lying sicke, or pining in pouerty. Touching y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> second, the change of his study; and being in the inner Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in <hi>London,</hi> at the study of the common Lawes, hee went to Cambridge to study Diuinity, where he heard D. <hi>Martin Bucer</hi> diligently, and was right familiar and deare vnto him. In this godly course he did (by Gods blessing) so profit, that that blessed Martir, D. <hi>Ridley,</hi> then B. of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> did, as it were, inuite him and his godly companion, M. <hi>Tho. Horton,</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come fellows of Penbrooke Hall in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge:</hi> And afterwards, the said D. <hi>Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> called our <hi>Bradford</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> gaue him a Prebend in <hi>Pauls</hi> Church, lodged him in his owne house there, and set him on worke in preaching. And besides, often preaching at <hi>Pauls</hi> Crosse, and els where in <hi>London,</hi> and sundry places in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and specially in <hi>Lancashire,</hi>
      <note n="*" place="margin">His na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try (for he was borne at <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester.</hi>)</note> he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched before K. <hi>Edward</hi> the sirt, in Lent, the last yeare of his reigne, vpon the <hi>2. Psalm:</hi> and there in one Sermon, shewing the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of Gods iudgement at hand, for the contempt of the Gospel, as y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> certain Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, vpon the Sabboth day, going in a Whirry to <hi>Paris Garden,</hi> to the Bearebai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting were drowned: and that a dogge was met at Ludgate, carying a piece of
<pb facs="6"/>dead child in his mouth: he with a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Propheticall spirit sayd. I sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon you all, euen euery mothers child of you, to the iudgement of God, for it is at hand; as it followed shortly after, in the death of K. <hi>Edward.</hi> In which state and labour of preaching he continued, till the cruelty of the Papists cut him off; as the history of his life and death (compiled by that faithfull seruant of the Lord Iesus, M. <hi>Iohn Foxe</hi>) sheweth.</p>
   <p>In all stops and stayes, in his labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous calling, he was much helped forward by a continuall meditation, and practise of repentance &amp; faith in Christ; in which he was kept by Gods grace, notably exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised all the dayes of his life. Euen in this meane time hee heard a Sermon, which that notable Preacher, M. <hi>Latimer</hi> made before K. <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6.</hi> in which bee did earnestly speake of restitution to bee made of things falsly gotten: which did so strike <hi>Bradford</hi> to the heart, for one dash of a pen which hee had made, without the knowledge of his master (as full often I haue heard him confesse with plenty of teares) being Clarke to the Treasurer of the Kings Campe beyond the Seas, and was to the deceiuing of the King, that he could neuer be quiet, till by the aduice of the same M. <hi>Latimer,</hi> a restitution was made. Which things to bring to passe, hee did willingly forbeare and forgoe all
<pb facs="7"/>the priuate &amp; certaine Patrimony which he had in earth. Let all bribers and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Officers learne their lesson here.</p>
   <p>But besides this, our <hi>Bradford</hi> had his daily exercises and practises of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. His maner was, to make to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a Catalogue of all the grosest &amp; most enorme sinnes, which in his life of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance he had committed, &amp; to lay the same before his eyes when he went to priuate praier, that by the sight &amp; remembrance of them, the better to stir him vp to offer to God the sacrifice of a contrite heart, and to pray for pardon and the increase of grace, to the detestation of sin, and loue of obeying the good will of God.</p>
   <p>His manner was this: Hee vsed in the morning to go to the Common prayer in the Colledge where hee was, and after that, hee vsed to make some prayer with his Pupils in his Chamber. But not content with this, he then repaired to his own secret praier, by himself, as one that had not yet praied to his own mind: for he was wont to say to his familiars, I haue prayed with my selfe. Let secure men mark this, which pray without touch of brest, as the Pharise did; and so that they haue sayd an ordinary prayer, or heare a common course of prayer, without any thing els, they thinke they haue prayed wel, and as the terme is, they haue serued
<pb facs="7"/>God wel. Let vs learne by <hi>Bradfords</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to pray better, that is, with the heart, and not with the lips alone, <hi>Quia Deus non vocis, sed cordis auditor est,</hi> as <hi>Cyprian</hi> sayth: that is, <hi>Because God is the hearer of the heart, and not of the voice:</hi> that is to say, not of the voice alone without the heart, for that is but lip-labour. This conscience of sin, and exercise in prayer had <hi>Bradford,</hi> cleane contrary to that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed custome of those gracelesse men, which doe ioy to make large accounts of their lewdnesse, and do glory therein; so feeding their delights with their liues passed, as the dogge returneth to smell of his cast gorge, and the horse to his dung; such as the Prophet, <hi>Esay 39.</hi> saith: <hi>They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their sinnes as Sodome, they hide them not, woe be to their soules.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Another of his exercises was his: He vsed to make vnto himselfe an <hi>Ephemeris,</hi> or a <hi>Iournall,</hi> in which he vsed to write all such notable things, as either he did see or heare, each day that passed. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he did heare or see, he did so pen it, that a man might see in that booke, the signes of his smitten heart. For, if hee did heare or see any good in any man, by that he found and noted the want there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in himselfe, and added a short prayer, crauing mercy, and grace to amend. If hee did heare or see any plague or misery, hee noted it as a thing procured by his
<pb facs="8"/>owne sinnes, and still added, <hi>Domine, mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere mei, <hi>Lord, haue mercy vpon me.</hi>
      </hi> He v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the same booke to note such euill thoughts as did rise in him; as of enuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the good of other men, thoughts of vnthankfulnesse, of not confidering God in his workes, of hardnes of heart, when he did see other moued and affected. And thus he made to himselfe, and of himselfe, a booke of daily practises of repentance.</p>
   <p>Besides this, they which familiarly kept company with him, might see how he vsed to fall often into a sudden and deepe meditation, in which hee would sit with fixed countenance and spirit moued, yet speaking nothing a good space. And some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in this silent sitting, plēty of tears should trickle downe his cheeks, Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time he would sit in it, and come out of it with a smiling countenance. Often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times haue I sate at dinner and supper with him, in the house of that godly har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer of many Preachers and seruants of the Lord Iesus, I meane M. <hi>Elsyng,</hi> when either by occasion of talke had, or of some view of Gods benefits present, or some inward cogitation and thought of his owne, he hath fallen into these deepe cogitations, and afterward he would tell me of them, that I did perceiue, that som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times his teares trickled out of his eyes, as well for ioy, as for sorrow. Neither was hee onely such a practiser of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb facs="8"/>in himselfe, but a continuall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoker of others thereunto, not onely in publike preaching, but also in priuate conference and company: for in all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies where he came, hee would freely reproue any sin and misbehauiour which appeared in any person; especially swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, filthy talkers, and popish praters: and this hee did with such a diuine grace and christian maiestie, that euer he stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the mouthes of the gaine-sayers: for be spake with power; and yet so sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they might see their euill to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and vnderstand that it was good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, to the which hee laboured to draw them in God.</p>
   <p>To be short, as his life was, such was his death: for at his death, as the History witnesseth, when the flames of fire did fly about his eares in Smithfield, his last speech, publikely noted &amp; heard was this, <hi>Repent England.</hi> Thus was our <hi>Bradford</hi> a Preacher, and an example of that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which he preached: As <hi>Ionas</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to Niniue (and yet doth) hee preach repentance; and surely England hath now much more cause to repent, then it had when <hi>Bradford</hi> liued: for all states and sorts of persons in England, are now more corrupt, then they were then.</p>
   <p>Let therefore now <hi>Bradfords</hi> Sermon, his life, his death, moue thee, O Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to repent; I wish and warne, that

      <pb facs="10"/>as in Niniue, so in England, all from the highest to the lowest, doe vnfainedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. The Court, the Church, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the Countrey, Princes, Prelates and people: let all and euery one repent, and depart from that euill which he hath in hand, and turne wholly to the Lord. And I do humbly beseech thy Maiesty (O glorious Lord Iesus) to worke now by thy Spirit in our hearts, the same sound repentance, which thy holinesse did first preach to men, when thou saydest: <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, for the Kingdome of God is at hand.</hi> This worke in vs, O gracious God our Sauiour. <hi>AMEN.</hi>
