   <head>THE PREFACE TO the Christian Reader.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE reade (Christian Reader) in the second Epistle of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3 <hi>verse,</hi> of a generall apostacie, or departing from the true Faith, which the great Antichrist should bring to passe before the comming of Christ, and before hee should be reuealed, or made manifest to the world. And wee read also in the 3. <hi>chap.</hi> and 10. <hi>verse</hi> of the <hi>Reuelation</hi> of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> of a generall temptation or triall that shall come vpon the world, to trie them that dwell vpon the earth. And in the 17. <hi>chap.</hi> wee reade by whom this temptation shall be made: especially in the 4. and 5. <hi>verses,</hi> where it is said of <hi>Romish Babylon,</hi> that she offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the world, <hi>In a cup of Gold</hi> (to wit in the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den name of Christ) <hi>the abhomination and filthinesse of her fornication.</hi> And in the 3. <hi>verse</hi> of the 18. <hi>chap.</hi> that she made all nations to drinke thereof. And in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>verse</hi> of the 17. <hi>chap.</hi> that shee made the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the earth drunke therewith. And therefore it is that the Angell in the 5. <hi>verse</hi> calleth Christian
<pb facs="5"/>
      <hi>Rome, Babylon, The mother of whordomes, and abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the earth:</hi> and for which (as appeareth in the 2. <hi>verse</hi> of the 19. <hi>chap.</hi>) the Lord hath condemned her.</p>
   <p>Now by this filthinesse of her fornication, all the learned doe know, is meant her whorish religion, as idolatrie, superstition, and heathenish worship: which very many that are yet liuing doe know, did ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow this Land, &amp; a great part of the Christian world, before the daies of <hi>King Henry</hi> the eight, when as God had appointed the effectuall beginning of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and restoring againe of the true Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as may appeare by a Prophecie written in an olde booke (I know not how many hundred yeeres agoe) Intituled, <hi>Stimulus diuinae contemplationis,</hi> which saith, <hi>After the yeere of Christs incarnation</hi> 1534. <hi>good Religion, good Lawes, good Peace, together with Faith, Truth, and sound Doctrine shall returne into the world in their proper shape and true likenesse.</hi> And this was also at the time of the rising of <hi>Luther,</hi> when as there was neither sound doctrine, true faith, nor religion to be found in all the <hi>Romish</hi> iurisdiction: according to that Prophecie of their S. <hi>Hildegard, a Nunne,</hi> which saith, <hi>In the Apostolike order</hi> (to wit, in the <hi>Roman Sea) no religion shall be found.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Truely, (Christian Reader) it seemeth very appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that God hath made speciall choyse of England aboue all the Nations in the world, to be the chiefe for the recouering and reducing of that part of his Church (the <hi>Romish</hi> iurisdiction) and the ouerthrow of Antichrists kingdome and religion. For whereas in the 17. <hi>chapter</hi> of the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> the tenne hornes are declared to be the maine strength of the seauen-hilled Citie (to wit <hi>Rome</hi>) and that the text declareth also
<pb facs="5"/>those hornes to be so many kingdomes, and that the learned expound them to be these tenne head king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the <hi>Romish</hi> iurisdiction, <hi>England, Scotland, Denmarke, &amp;c.</hi> (the first whereof, that withdrew her power from <hi>Rome,</hi> was England) it is manifest En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland is the chiefe.</p>
   <p>I know (Christian Reader) it would be thought strange to say, that that which was done by <hi>King Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> was foretold in the booke of the <hi>Reuelation.</hi> Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, a very learned man writing vpon these words, in the 13. <hi>verse</hi> of the 11. <hi>chap. (And the tenth part of the Citie shall fall)</hi> saith plainely, <hi>It is a thousand to one but that it is meant of King Henry:</hi> meaning his with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing his power from <hi>Rome.</hi> And indeed it is tenne thousand to one, but that it is meant of him: For plaine experience doth euidently demonstrate En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland to be the chiefe of those tenne Kingdomes also, which the 16. <hi>verse</hi> of the 17. <hi>chap.</hi> declareth shall be the meanes of the finall fall of the Citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> and power of Antichrist: for that, after this worke was set abroach by <hi>King Henry,</hi> we saw it so greatly to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile vnder the raigne of that famous Queene his Daughter <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that at her decease, the Pope had scarce three of those Kingdomes (signified by those hornes) left to adhere with him intirely. And I doe finde also by diuers of the olde <hi>Romish</hi> Predictions, that as God made <hi>King Henry</hi> the maine beginner of the ruine and decay of the strength of <hi>Romish Babylon,</hi> so he hath ordained a most worthy <hi>King</hi> of the name of <hi>Iacob,</hi> to second him in that worke. And as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which shall be further effected by him, thus hath their <hi>Robertus</hi> a <hi>Dominican Frier</hi> written long
<pb facs="6"/>agoe in his second <hi>Sermon.</hi> But <hi>Iacob flying from the Serpents face,</hi> (which Serpent in his third <hi>vision,</hi> hee affirmeth the spirit told him was Antichrist the <hi>Pope) is ioyned to those that doe praise my name.</hi> For which cause (hee declareth) the <hi>Pope</hi> (whom in the same Sermon hee compareth to <hi>Esau</hi>) should put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise the destruction of the spirituall <hi>Iacob,</hi> as also for refusing to ioyne with him, and to be of his societie: For there hee bringeth in the Pope, speaking in this manner to his spirituall sonnes; <hi>Goe to my Sonnes, and enter into a consultation among your selues, how I may bring him vnder; for by his destruction my trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure shall bee exceedingly increased: I haue neede of much, because the name of my house is great vpon the face of the earth. Deglutiamus eum virum: Come therefore, let vs swallow him vp aliue.</hi> Which Prophecie, albeit wee saw fulfilled in the Powder-treason, yet as the same <hi>Frier</hi> sheweth, that all the <hi>Pope</hi> could doe should nothing at all preuaile; so, thankes be to our good God we saw it did not.</p>
   <p>Againe, the same <hi>Frier,</hi> in his sixeteenth Sermon, fore-sheweth that it shall come to passe, that the same <hi>Iacob</hi> (whom there hee calleth the <hi>Lyon King</hi>) shall visite the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Roman</hi> and other Catholique Princes of Christendome, by his Christian and royall exhortations, to helpe to subdue the <hi>Pope,</hi> and to bring the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same state of primitiue puritie, as it was in the happy dayes of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, <hi>Theodosius, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian, &amp;c.</hi> Whereby he declareth, not onely how greatly the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is fallen from her primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue purity in religion, but also, that shee shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the speciall meanes of our Nation of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
      <pb facs="6"/>And to the like effect are these words of their Saint <hi>Bridgit,</hi> (cannonized for a Saint by <hi>Pope Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> the ninth) in her sixt booke of <hi>Reuelations,</hi> 26. chap. where she bringeth in Christ complayning of the decaied state of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> shewing him to exhort all Christian <hi>Kings</hi> what course to take for the perfect reformation thereof, saying; <hi>Wherefore the King for whom thou dost pray, ought to call and assemble a Councell of Spirituall men, such as are wise through my wisedome; and he ought to enquire diligently of those that haue my spirite, and aske their aduice, how, and by what meanes the wall of my Church may be built againe amongst Christians, how God may be restored to his honour, true Religion made to flourish anew, godly charity made more feruent, my passion more deepely imprinted in the hearts and mindes of men, and my Commaundements loued with greater zeale and respect: Let him therefore gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the vpright and true kinde of Christians, that hee to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with them, may repaire the spirituall breaches of my Church, the which verily hath departed too farre from mee.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>By which wee see, shee giueth all true Christian Princes to vnderstand, that God requireth of them, that they ioyne together, and vse all meanes by god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and learned instructers, to reclayme the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, and to reduce her to that most auncient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique faith and religion, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended her for at the first: which albeit at the first, or on the sodaine shee will not receiue; but as their <hi>Abbot Ioachim</hi> vpon the 22. chapter of <hi>Ieremy</hi> sayth: <hi>Will stoppe her eares, lest shee should heare the charming of the inchaunter, the voyce of him that admonisheth her:</hi> yet vpon the 15.17.18.21. and 22. chapters, he show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb facs="7"/>that those admonitions shall, in short time, so worke, that not onely the <hi>Germaine</hi> Empire shall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but the Church it selfe, with her <hi>Colledge of Cardinalls shal be diuided, and fall into dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord among themselues.</hi> And vpon the 50. and 51. of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> he sheweth by the effect, that those admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions shall so greatly preuaile, that the <hi>Pope</hi> and the whole order of his Clergie, his Consistorie and State, shall be exceedingly impaired. For (saith he) <hi>The No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Romaine Church shall perish, the Monasteries shall be diminished, the High. Priest shall be purified, and Christian Religion shall be winnowed as with a fanne.</hi> And the same also did their Saint <hi>Katharine</hi> of <hi>Sienne</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see, as may appeare by these her words written in a prayer of hers: <hi>But what shall the Lord doe to these euill husband men? he shall come and destroy them, and let out his Vineyard vnto others, &amp;c. By tribulations and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in such a manner as we know not, he shall purge his Church, and to that purpose shall stirre vp the spirits of his Elect. After which things</hi> (saith she) <hi>shall ensue such a reformation of the holy Church, and such a renouation of the godly Pastors thereof, that the very thoughts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of maketh my spirit to reioyce in the Lord. And as I haue tolde you heretofore</hi> (saith she) <hi>the Spouse which is now altogether deformed, ragged and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>orne, shall then be ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and decked as it were with precious iewels and chains: And all faithfull people shall be glad when they are thus beautified with so holy Pastors. Yea, the very Infidells be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawne with the sweete smell of Christ, shall repaire vnto the Catholike sheepfold, and be conuerted to the chiefe Pastor and Bishop of their soules.</hi> And this is it also which <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> did foresee, as may appeare by these his words, written in his nineteenth
<pb facs="7"/>booke the ninth chap. vpon <hi>Iob: The Church after the dayes of her afflictions, shall afterwards, notwithstanding, be strengthened with great power of preaching.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>And that it may yet more plainely appeare, that our Nation of <hi>England</hi> shall beare some sway in this worke, the aforesaid <hi>Dominican Frier,</hi> in his sixt <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> declareth that it was reuealed vnto him, <hi>That the Ile of Britaine should proue the chiefe receptacle</hi> of the Church of God, and euen an <hi>Asile</hi> or <hi>Sanctuary</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the time of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, and as it were her nursing mother, after she should come to be thus reformed: and that the true Christian religion should be maintained especially by the blessed meanes of the people of the aforesaid <hi>Isle.</hi> For, <hi>As the title of his Vision</hi> (saith the Translator) <hi>is of the future state of the Church, so the Vision it selfe doth beare how he did seeme to be together with some other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in a small number in a certaine great ship, not well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed with Ruthers or Oares in the maine Sea, and that the shippe came as it were of it selfe vnto a certaine Island, whereunto</hi> (saith he) <hi>we being but a few, had our recourse for refuge and safety.</hi> Also to the like effect there is this prognosticall <hi>verse,</hi> aledged by <hi>Ioannes Wolfius</hi> in the second <hi>tome of his memorable things:</hi> in <hi>Latine</hi> thus:
<q>
         <l>Europa genit us terra, vir iust us &amp; aequus</l>
         <l>Pastor erit, Caeli claues non regna gubernans.</l>
         <l>Pax erit, &amp; toto surget concordia Mundo</l>
         <l>Vna Fides vnus regnabit in omnia Princeps.</l>
      </q>
   </p>
   <p>In English thus; <hi>A certaine wight equitable and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right borne in</hi> Europe, <hi>shall be the chiefe Pastor or Bishop of Christendome, such a one as shall mannage and gouerne the Keyes of the kingdome of Heauen, and not the Scepters of the kingdomes of the earth. There shall be peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
<pb facs="8"/>in the world one Faith and Religion, and once Prince imperially raigning ouer all.</hi> Also their <hi>Paracelsus</hi> the <hi>German Hermite,</hi> in his 26. Prediction, maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an English Prince and his issue, that shall more fully effect this worke of reformation. And in an old Prophesie had out of the <hi>Pallace of wisdome, in Rome;</hi> and in another Prophesie of <hi>Sauanarola,</hi> a <hi>Dominican Frier,</hi> mention is made of a Prince of the name of <hi>Charles,</hi> that shall strike a great stroke in this worke, and shall bring to passe, that in the end, according to a Prophesie also of <hi>Nostrodamus, Rome</hi> shall be ruled by her old <hi>Britannish</hi> head.</p>
   <div type="part">
      <head>Cant. <hi>5.</hi> quadrin. <hi>99.</hi> Quand Rome aurale chef vieux Britantique.</head>
      <p>And saith Maister <hi>Iames Maxwell</hi> (the Translater) <hi>As the Italian Iesuite Heronymus Platus</hi> in the second booke of <hi>Religious life,</hi> chap. 30. confesseth England to haue beene more fertill of conuerters of Nations and Countries to the Christian faith, then any other Land else; so is it not vnlikely but that God will haue the same Country to be more fertill of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of other corrupt Churches, especially of that of <hi>Rome,</hi> then any other Land whatsoeuer. And that as there is in no one Country or Nation of the world to be found so many learned and eloquent Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, nor so many compleat Diuines, for <hi>Iudiciousnesse, Ingenuousnesse</hi> and <hi>moderation,</hi> and for fitnesse to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue well for the peace of the Church, as there is in England; so it is like that God will honour this <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sland</hi> with the reformation of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and her daughters, by sending forth from thence, such godly, iudicious, zealous, and moderate men, as shall reclaime them from their abuses, and restore
<pb facs="8"/>vnto them their Primitiue puritie and integritie, such as it was in the happie daies of <hi>Constantine the Great,</hi> borne in great Britannie. For (saith hee) <hi>To the same effect soundeth this prognosticall verse, which was found in an old manuscript:</hi>
         <q>
            <l>Iesse Rosa sanguis Bruti</l>
            <l>Portat Crucem Iesu Christi.</l>
            <l>The Rose of England beareth and bringeth</l>
            <l>the Crosse of Christ to forraigne Lands.</l>
         </q>
      </p>
      <p>Also as their <hi>Ioachim</hi> the <hi>Abbot,</hi> writing vpon the 4.5.18.22. and 30. Chapter of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> sheweth that there shall be certaine new Preachers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in the Catholique or Vniuersall Church, strong in faith, and true in Doctrine, whose Doctrine shall be open and free, and that they shall preach Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance both to the <hi>Greekes</hi> and <hi>Latines,</hi> and conuert many of them to the truth; so is there a certain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie vttered in the yeare of Christ, 1119. as wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> in his 475. <hi>Page</hi> of this <hi>History,</hi> which saith; <hi>They that walke in darkenesse, shall turne to the light, and those things that were diuided and scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, shall be gathered together and vnited.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Also, the same <hi>Abbot</hi> sheweth, how that the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Prelates</hi> will rage against those whom God shall send to conuert them, where hee writing vpon the first Chapter of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> saith thus; <hi>Such Doctors and Prophets are to be sent, which shall not onely rebuke the people, but also thunder out against the Priests, and strike earthly and carnall hearts with all maner of plagues, and put to silence the loftie and swelling Maisters, who shall fight against the aforesaid Preachers which shall be reuealed, as once did Iuda against Israel, and the Iewes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Christ and his Apostles.</hi> By meanes whereof, the
<pb facs="9"/>death of <hi>Philip</hi> the second <hi>King of Spaine</hi>) in his <hi>Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum mundi filum,</hi> doth deliuer, that <hi>The Lyon hauing the Rose and the Lillies in his armes, shall vtterly destroy the Pope, so as that afterwards there shall neuer be any more Popes.</hi> And then all Christian Princes, being at peace and vnitie, it seemeth by a Prediction found in an olde Booke, that they shall consent and agree, to chuse out of all, one excellent Man for learning and good life, to be as a chiefe Moderator, for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all sorts of people in the whole world to one kinde of Religion, and all Churches into one vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme order: For thus it is written in that Prophesie, <hi>The afflictions of the Church and Clergie being passed; and after so many &amp; great tribulations, by the will of God, a most holy man shall be chosen, perfect in all manner of perfection, who shall reforme the World in better, and shall bring backe all Clergie-men to the ancient and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue manner of liuing, according to the forme of the Disciples of Christ: He shall conuert the Infidels, and the Iewes, &amp;c. And so there shall be one Law, one faith, and one Baptisme, and one manner of liuing; and all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an people shall be of one minde, and of one heart, louing one another, and their peace shall last many yeares: but after the world hath beene reformed into better, the malice of men shall againe awake, and they shall returne to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the former euils, yea they shall doe more wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then ere they did before, for the which cause God shall hasten the end of the World.</hi> And as the authors of those Prophesies (who fore-told of the vtter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation of <hi>Rome</hi>) seemed to allude vnto the 21.22.23. and 24. Verses of the eighteenth chapter of the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> by which words in those Verses, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell fore-shewed the same; so the latter end of this
<pb facs="9"/>old Prophesie, seemeth to haue relation to these words of Christ in the 12. Verse of the 24. Chapter of Saint <hi>Matthew: And because iniquitie shall be increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, the loue of many shall be cold:</hi> As also, to these words in the 22. Verse (according to the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of some) <hi>And except those daies should be shorte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, there should no flesh be saued: But for the Elect sake, those daies shall be shortned.</hi> And the former part see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth also to allude vnto those words in the sixe and twentieth and 27. Verses of the 7. Chapter of the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> which sheweth, that after Antichrist and his Kingdome is ouerthrowne, the fulnesse of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> shall come in, and the <hi>Iewes</hi> shall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and so all shall be conuerted to the truth, and serue the onely true God. Neuerthelesse, wee may not vnderstand it to be meant of euery particular of all. For howsoeuer Antichrist the Head, and his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessiue incorporate body, shall vtterly be desolued, so as that there shall neuer be any more a publique Church of Antichrist; yet euen as it is now here in England, and the other conuerted Nations, some of the members of the misticall body of Antichrist, will remaine scattered here and there in diuers parts of the World to the comming of Christ to iudgement. For to the same effect are these words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,</hi> 2. Chapter, where he speaking of Antichrist and his members, saith; <hi>Whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and abolish with the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his comming.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>And as that old Prophesie did foreshew the calling of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> by the meanes of a godly and learned Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, so in another Prediction had out of the Bishop of <hi>Limoges Library</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> vttered more then 600.
<pb facs="10"/>Yeeres agoe, it is said that an holy Bishop shall cause a generall <hi>Councell</hi> to be called, and shall perswade Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Princes to ioyne together all their powers against the <hi>Sarazens,</hi> and to rid <hi>Ierusalem</hi> of them, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, the same Bishop, because of the iniquity of the <hi>Romans,</hi> shall translate Saint <hi>Peters Chaire</hi> to <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> and shall suffer none other <hi>Law,</hi> but that onely of Iesus Christ.</p>
      <p>And to this agreeth that Prophesie of <hi>Sauanarola</hi> the <hi>Dominican Friar,</hi> which (to shew, that as <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was the first Church, and the chiefe of all other, so it should be at the last) saith thus: <hi>I saw in a vision in the yeere of our Lord,</hi> 1482. <hi>two Crosses, the one was blacke, planted in the middest of the City of Rome, sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as it were the armes ouer the whole Earth, and with the top touching the whole Heauen; whereon was written these words;</hi> Crux Irae Dei: <hi>The Crosse of Gods anger or wrath: which hauing seene, behold incontinent, I beheld and saw the aire darkened and troubled with tempestuous cloudes, windes, lightnings, darts, swords, fire, and haile; and mee thought I saw an innumerable number of men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed through the force and violence thereof, so that few were left behinde vnslaine: Afterwards, I saw a sweete, faire, and cleare time ensuing; and loe, I beheld, and saw as it were a golden Crosse in the middest of Ierusalem, of the brightnesse and height of the former, so bright that it did inlighten the whole World, and filled the same with new ioy and gladnesse; and it had written vpon it.</hi> Crux mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricordiae Dei. <hi>The Crosse of the mercy and fauour of God: and loe, incontinent and on a suddaine, all the Nations of the World, of both Sexe came in troupes from all parts to behold it,</hi>
         <note place="margin">Esay, cap. 2. Verse 2.</note>
         <hi>and imbraced it.</hi> And this Vision seemeth to agree with that Prophesie of <hi>Esay,</hi> Chap. the 2. where
<pb facs="10"/>it is said: <hi>It shall be in the last dayes, that the mountaine of the house of the Lord shall be prepared in the top of the mountaines, and shall be exalted aboue the hilles, and all Nations shall flow vnto it.</hi> And also with these words of Saint <hi>Paul, Romans</hi> 11. <hi>If the fall of them</hi> (to wit, <hi>the Iewes) be the riches of the World, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles, how much more shall their abundance be?</hi>
      </p>
      <p>By which, and other such like Visions (saith the Translator) <hi>the aforesaid holy man</hi> Sauanarola <hi>was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned of the future castigation and renouation of the Church of Rome, and how that the Apostolike Sea should be remoued from thence to Ierusalem, which is likewise ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Prediction of the Franciscan Friar,</hi> Ioannes de Rupe scissa, <hi>and also to another Prediction had out of</hi> Limoges <hi>Library in</hi> France; <hi>and finally, to the Prediction of</hi> Marlinus Caldidonius.</p>
      <p>And now (Christian Reader) as it seemeth appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant by these <hi>Romish Predictions</hi> (agreeable to the Scriptures) that God respecteth <hi>England,</hi> as the holy Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> so is it made yet more apparant by <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> in his second Booke of his <hi>Kings,</hi> and second Booke of his <hi>Bishops;</hi> where hee sheweth that in a Vision to holy <hi>Brithwall</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> this voyce was vttered; <hi>Regnum Anglorum est Dei:</hi> The Kingdome of England is Gods. Which signifieth, that howsoeuer all the Nations in the world are Gods as well as <hi>England;</hi> yet hath God made spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall choyce of <hi>England</hi> aboue all other Nations in the World, to effect some notable and extraordinary worke; which worke we may easily gather by all the former Predictions, is to be a chiefe instrument of the propagation of the Gospell to forraigne Lands, both
<pb facs="11"/>for the calling in of the remainder of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and also of the whole Nation of the <hi>Iewes.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>To the which I beseech our Lord God, to giue good successe, and to send peace and agreement amongst the <hi>Electors.</hi> For their Astrologian <hi>Ruth,</hi> in the second part of his Booke, 7. Chapter, sheweth that there shall be great tribulation and diuision amongst them, and therefore admonisheth them to agree, lest the Turke get so great aduantage by their discord, as to driue the <hi>Bohemian, Polonians, Danes,</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> to be glad to contract a league of amity with him: which thing God forbid, and which we ought all to pray God to auert: For now we see is the time come for the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this Prophesie.</p>
   </div>
   <div type="part">
      <head>Lord giue a blessing to my labour: and open the eyes of the blinde.</head>
      <p>But now, what good effect can wee looke to haue, that the fruit of this our labour should any thing at all preuaile to conuert any Papists, seeing we finde in the 16. Chapter, 10. Verse. and 9. Chapter, 20.21. Verses of the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> that neither the Word of God, nor the iudgements of God shall conuert them? surely none, were it not that the Lord in the 4. Verse of the 18 Chapter had reuealed, that euen to the finall destruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> he hath yet reserued some to himselfe; of which sort therefore, we hope it will take effect in some: but for the rest, we haue had sufficient experience, that the more plainer and clearer the truth is made vnto them, the more they will labour with their cunning shifts, and sophisticall arguments, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure it; yea, and if it be possible, they will make it seem
<pb facs="11"/>vntruth. Howbeit, euen hereby they most euidently declare themselues, to be of the fellowship of those Antichristians whom <hi>S. Paul</hi> 2 <hi>Thessalonians</hi> 2 chap. sheweth the great Antichrist shall so strongly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude, that they shall delight rather to beleeue his lies, then Gods truth.</p>
      <p>And that it may appeare to the Reader, they are indeed the same, what can make it more apparent, then their apposing themselues against the Doctrine of Christ himselfe? For whereas the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> chap. 4. fore-told of <hi>Elias</hi> that was to come, and that our Sauiour Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. expoundeth that to be meant of Saint <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> in saying of him, <hi>This is that</hi> Elias <hi>that was to come; Hee that hath eares to heare, let him heare:</hi> They sticke not to appose themselues against his plaine exposition, and constantly affirme, that the same <hi>Elias</hi> is yet to come. Also, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Euangelist</hi> Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> in his first chapter, 17. Verse, sheweth <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> to be the same of whom <hi>Malachi</hi> fore-told; who, as hee saith, <hi>Came in the spirit and power of Elias, to prepare the way for Christ:</hi> They say that the end of his comming, is to appose himselfe against Antichrist. And this is done to make vs beleeue that Antichrist is not yet come. But in the meane time, their affirming <hi>Elias</hi> to be yet to come (which should come but once) and that onely to manifest the <hi>Messias</hi> to bee verily come; What is this, but by a consequent, to affirme, that the <hi>Messias</hi> is yet to come, and so our faith in him that is come, is made voyd, and of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect?</p>
      <p>Againe, whereas our Sauiour Christ, as appeareth <hi>Matthew</hi> 24. saith; <hi>And this Gospel of the Kingdome
<pb facs="12"/>shall be preached through out the whole World for a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to all Nations, and then shall the end come:</hi> They peruert both words &amp; sense, &amp; say; <hi>And then shall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist come.</hi> And this also is done only to make men beleeue that Antichrist is not yet come, that no man should once suspect the <hi>Pope</hi> to be he, albeit the truth forceth all men to beleeue the contrary. But it may well appeare they meane nothing lesse, then that the truth should come to light; for then <hi>N. D.</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the <hi>Ward-word,</hi> in alledging the 8. Verse of the 11. chapter of the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> to proue the seat of Antichrist to be in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> would not haue taken out of the Text, the word <hi>Spiritually</hi> (which all men may see, the holy Ghost put in purposely to preserue the sense) that he might adde a contrary, <hi>to wit,</hi> such a sense of his owne, as should shadow <hi>Rome</hi> for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to be the seate, and the <hi>Pope</hi> from being An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist. I say, if hee had beene willing the Reader should haue beene resolued by truth, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue done it.</p>
      <p>But what hath he gotten by this his adding, and deminishing too and from the words and sense of that Prophesie, let him looke into the 18. and 19. Verses of the 22. chap. of the same Booke, and he shall finde it to be no lesse then eternall damnation both of body and soule, because it is wittingly done?</p>
      <p>Againe, if he had beene willing that men should haue beene resolued by the truth, he might more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily haue found out the seate of Antichrist to be in <hi>Rome,</hi> then in <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> because the 17. chapter of the <hi>Reuelation</hi> sheweth it to be in the Citie with seauen hills, and which raigneth ouer the Kings of the earth; but <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was neuer described by
<pb facs="12"/>seauen hills, nor euer raigned ouer the Kings of the earth, nor any other Citie in all the world, but <hi>Rome;</hi> therefore not <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> but <hi>Rome,</hi> is the seate of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist.</p>
      <p>Againe, if he had been willing that the truth should haue resolued the Reader, (who hee is, that is in deed and truth the great Antichrist) hee would neuer haue wrested and falsified so many places of Scripture, as appeareth (in his <hi>Ward-word,</hi> Page 91.92.) he hath done wittingly, to proue him a <hi>Iewe,</hi> and to dominiere onely ouer that one Nation of the <hi>Iewes:</hi> I say, if hee had beene willing that men should haue beene resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the truth, he would neuer haue done it. If he shall charge vs with doing him wrong, for saying hee hath wrested and falsified the places he hath cited; I say againe, not any one of his places doth proue the point: if it did, then hee hath done himselfe the wrong; for that after so many places cited, hee bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the 5. Verse of the 13. chapter of the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> which being vnderstood (as he would haue it) of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, the three next Verses following, proueth him a <hi>Gentile,</hi> and a <hi>Roman:</hi> vnto whom (as the Text saith) <hi>Power was giuen ouer euery kindred, tongue, and Nation, and whom the World worshipped.</hi> So that here he hath vtterly shamed himselfe, for that this Text (as he vnderstandeth it) proueth all his former ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections but Antichristian illusions, and fond fables.</p>
      <p>Againe, if he had beene willing that the Reader should haue beene resolued by the truth, hee would not haue laboured to haue enduced him to beleeue that Antichrist should seduce the <hi>Iewes,</hi> &amp; that they should receiue him for their <hi>Messias</hi> and Sauiour, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he cannot proue by any one place of Scripture
<pb facs="13"/>(from the first chapter of <hi>Genesis,</hi> to the last chapter of the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> that there shall be any other tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation, or alteration of the <hi>Iewes</hi> state to come, but onely that in the 11. to the <hi>Romans,</hi> which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth, shall be their conuertion to Christ, and the same to continue to the comming of Christ to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
      <p>Againe, if he had beene willing men should haue beene resolued by the truth, hee would neuer haue expounded the Image of the <hi>Heathenish Roman</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, to be a painted picture, or a carued I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, the likenesse of some kind of cattell, or beast, onely to blind the World, that men should not see the <hi>Popish</hi> gouernement to be the Image. Howbeit, let them looke into the 8. verse of the 14. chap. and they shall see; and into the 9.10. and 11. Verses of the same, and they shall know, to their euerlasting woe, that by the Beast is meant the <hi>Heathen Roman</hi> gouernment, and by the image of the beast, the <hi>Popish Roman</hi> gouernment. But he that was the author of the <hi>Ward-word,</hi> would not that men should know this. Therefore we see, he is not willing that men should be resolued by the truth.</p>
      <p>Againe, if the <hi>Papists</hi> in generall, had beene willing the truth should haue come to light, that men might haue beene resolued in the truth of <hi>Babylon,</hi> they would not in the <hi>Remish Testament,</hi> haue expounded <hi>Babylon</hi> (in the seauententh chapter of the <hi>Reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>) to signifie the Vniuersall societie of the wicked, seeing the holy Ghost sheweth in the same Chapter, that by <hi>Babylon,</hi> is meant the Citie with seauen hils, and that raigned ouer the Kings of the earth: But to say that the Reprobates of the world, are scituated
<pb facs="13"/>vpon those seauen hils, and raigned ouer the Kings of the earth, is most ridiculous. Therefore, we see they are not willing the truth should come to light.</p>
      <p>Againe, if they had beene willing that men should haue beene resolued by the truth, they would neuer haue giuen that exposition; seeing that by <hi>Babylon,</hi> is signified also the woman offering to the World, in the name of Christ, her whorish Religion, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the 4. Verse of the same chapter.</p>
      <p>Againe, if they had beene willing to haue brought the truth to light, that men might haue beene truely resolued in that point; then, seeing the Angell in the same place, shewed to Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> that hee spake to him of <hi>Romes</hi> estate, offering to the World her Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in a Golden cup (that is, in the name of Christ) they would neuer haue expounded it of <hi>Heathenish Rome</hi> vnder the <hi>Heathen</hi> Emperours; for they know as well as wee, that she disdained once to handle that cup, and persecuted any whosoeuer offered to her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny truth therein.</p>
      <p>But why should we stand any longer in the repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticion of these things now, seeing that by the holy Ghost, the misterie of the Golden cup is reuealed, and the truth laid open, that it is Christian <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Angell called <hi>Babylon, the mother of whoredomes and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations of the earth.</hi> And then seeing Christian <hi>Rome</hi> is the mother of whordomes and abominations of the earth, the <hi>Pope</hi> must needes be the father of whordomes and abominations of the earth: and he that is the father of whordomes and abominations of the earth, must needes be the great Antichrist. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here all their mouthes are stopped, and all their cunning arguments desolued, and all their chiefe
<pb facs="14"/>points, craftie shifts, and vntruths abandoned, which they would haue, should make vs to beleeue that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist is not yet come, that wee should not suspect the <hi>Pope</hi> to be he.</p>
      <p>As touching the exposition of the Golden cup, let them deny it to be the true meaning of the holy Ghost if they dare; but they haue denied too much of the truth of that Booke already, as one day they shall finde.</p>
      <p>All the benefits of saluation which wee receiue in Christ, the Prophet <hi>Dauid, Psal.</hi> 116. calleth the <hi>Cup of saluation.</hi> And his name may well be called the Golden Cup, because as S. <hi>Luke</hi> saith, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.19. <hi>There is giuen none other name vnder heauen, whereby men must be saued.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>And yet to shew that all that professe Christ shall not be saued, our Sauiour Christ fore-telleth, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnder his name many shall be deceiued: which surely is a wonderfull great iudgement of God, vpon that people whosoeuer they be.</p>
      <p>
         <hi>Erasmus</hi> expounding the misterie of that cup, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that that which is offered therein, is nothing else but the <hi>Popes</hi> religion, which (he saith) he offereth in the name of Christ, to deceiue the world. And their <hi>Abbot Ioachim</hi> witnesseth the same, as may plainely appeare in his 37. chapter vpon the Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> where he complaining of the corruption of the <hi>Popes,</hi> saith: <hi>They doe neglect Incense and Myrrh, but they seeke after Gold, that they may with Babylon, the great Lady of the world, fill vnto men Wine in a golden Cup, to infect their followers with their abhominations.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>And thus by the opening the misterie of the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Cup, we see the Lord hath now made knowne to
<pb facs="14"/>his Church, that Christian <hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the <hi>Pope</hi> professing Christ, is Antichrist. Yea, the same of whom Saint <hi>Hylary</hi> saith:
<note place="margin">
            <hi>Hylary</hi> contra <hi>Auxenium.</hi>
         </note>
         <hi>Antichrist shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Christ, vnder a colour of preaching the Gospell, so that our Lord Iesus Christ shall then be denied, when a man would thinke he were preached.</hi> And herein also the <hi>Pope</hi> agreeth to the signification of the name, as it is in the <hi>Greeke;</hi> namely, to be both for, and against Christ, 2 <hi>Thessa.</hi> 2. to sit as the Church, the deare friend of Christ, and yet to be as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>An aduersarie:</hi> Therefore, doubtlesse, he cannot be said to be the great Antichrist, that is, not ouer-ruling all, both for and against Christ.</p>
      <p>Their Saint <hi>Vincent,</hi> intreating of the end of the World, sheweth of two kindes of Antichrists, the one he calleth a pure Antichrist, <hi>to wit,</hi> the <hi>Turke;</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he calleth a mixed kind of Antichrist, which he saith shall be an euill <hi>Pope,</hi> made by an euill prince of great power, alluding to <hi>Boniface</hi> the third, who was made the first <hi>Pope,</hi> by that Murtherer <hi>Phocas</hi> the Emperour of <hi>Rome.</hi> And their <hi>Astrologian Ruth,</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Antichrist, saith: <hi>Hee shall be called Antichristus mixtus, whom the Prelates shall greatly honour.</hi> And this he spake, not of himselfe, for hee found it so written in an olde Prophesie, as himselfe confesseth in his thirtie foure Chapter, of the second part of his Booke.</p>
      <p>To be briefe, and to draw to an end; this I aduise the Reader to note well, that forasmuch as the same Apostle, <hi>Ephesians,</hi> 4.6. sheweth, that as there is but one God, and that he alone is the Vniuersall father of all; And that Christ himselfe, <hi>Matthew</hi> 23.9. for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad the title of Vniuersall father to be giuen to any,
<pb facs="15"/>but to the Father of Heauen; it is cleare he is a most horrible blasphemer, that will call the most holiest man vpon the earth, vniuersall Father of all: much more hee that will call Antichrist, the <hi>Pope,</hi> vniuersall father of all, seeing the Holy ghost calleth him, <hi>The man of sinne, and sonne of perdition,</hi> 2 <hi>Thessal.</hi> 2.</p>
      <p>Againe, forasmuch as the same Apostle, <hi>Galatians</hi> 4.26. saith, <hi>Ierusalem which is aboue, is the mother of vs all:</hi> he is a most horrible blasphemer, that will call the most holiest Citie heere beneath, the mother of vs all: much more hee that will call <hi>Rome</hi> the Mother of vs all, which the Angell of God calleth <hi>Babylon, The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of whoredomes and abominations of the earth.</hi>
      </p>
      <p>Againe, forasmuch as the very selfe and same reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which <hi>Rome</hi> now offereth to the world in the name of Christ, is by the Angell in the 4 verse of the 17. chapter of the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> compared vnto the stinking filthinesse of a whoores fornication, he must needes be a most horrible blasphemer, that will call it, The most auncient, true, and holy Catholique religion.</p>
      <p>Againe, forasmuch as the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> 2. <hi>Thessalon.</hi> 2. declareth, that the comming of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, shall be with great signes and wonders, yea, so great and wonderfull, that as our Sauiour Christ saith, <hi>Matthew</hi> 24. <hi>If it were possible, they should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the very Elect.</hi> Hee therefore that will say, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> must needes be the true Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause shee worketh miracles, is a most horrible blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer.</p>
      <p>Miracles are wrought in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by the spirits of Diuels, as appeareth in the 16. chapter and 14. verse of the <hi>Reuelation:</hi> Therefore miracles
<pb facs="15"/>are not alwayes a true note of the true Church. And this appeareth also in the thirteenth chapter of <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy,</hi> where we may see, that a most vile kinde of people, euen such as God abhorred, wrought mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, to draw others to their religion. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> also declareth, 2. <hi>Thessalon.</hi> 2. <hi>verse</hi> 10. that Antichrist shall worke his miracles among them that perish: therefore miracles are not alwayes a true note of the true Church.</p>
      <p>Againe, our Sauiour Christ, <hi>Matthew</hi> 7.22. decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that at the day of Iudgement, certaine Christian Ministers that were wont to confirme their doctrine by miracles, when they shall see themselues cast out to be damned with reprobates, they will admire, and say thus to Christ: <hi>Lord, Lord, haue we not by thy Name prophecied, and by thy Name cast out Diuels, and done ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great workes? And then</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>I will professe to them, I neuer knew you, depart from me yee that worke iniquitie. Popish</hi> Ministers worke miracles, our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters worke none; they themselues therefore shall be iudges in this case, to which of these sort of Ministers, this Scripture may iustly be applyed.</p>
      <p>Certainely, the greatest iudgement that God doth lay vpon men in this life, is to blinde their vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with <hi>Poperie;</hi> for then they are willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any errour, and to reiect the truth; to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with the marke of the Beast, and to receiue the print of his name, and to perish with the Beast and the false Prophet, as it is most certaine they shall: For thus it is written in the nineteenth chapter of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation</hi> verse 20. <hi>But the Beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb facs="16"/>he deceiued them that receiued the Beasts marke, and them that worshipped his image. These both were aliue cast into a lake of fire, burning with brimstone.</hi> Therefore to conclude this, I say to all those that haue receiued the marke of the Beast, in their forehead, or on their hand; that is, they that haue outwardly professed with their mouthes and gestures; and those also that haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by Armes, written Bookes, wrought Miracles, or any way laid to their helping hand, to do any thing whereby the <hi>Popes</hi> kingdome and state is maintained, Damnation shall be their end. For as the Angell of God, in the foureteenth chapter of the same booke, 9.10. and 11. verses saith, <hi>If any man worship the Beast, and his Image, and receiue his marke in his forehead, or on their hand, the same shall drinke of the wine of the wrath of God, yea, of the pure wine which is powred into the Cup of his wrath, and he shal be termented in fire and brimstone before the holie Angells, and before the Lambe, and the smoake of their torment shall ascend euermore: and they shall haue no rest day nor night, which worship the Beast and his image: and whosoeuer receiueth the print of his name,</hi> That is, whosoeuer is content to be called by any such name, as whereby he may be knowne to be the <hi>Popes</hi> faithfull subiect. Therefore I aduertise them all, in the name of God, that they receiue his fatherly admonitions, and call to minde, how louingly the Lord in the fourth verse of the eighteenth chapter of the same Booke, calleth his Elect out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that they be not partakers of her sinnes, lest they should also receiue of her plagues. As for those that regard not this louing fauour of God, but will notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding abide in her still, and goe on with her in her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominations,
<pb facs="16"/>let them goe, and doe what they will. <hi>He that is vniust</hi> (saith the Lord in the 22. chapter) <hi>let him be vniust still, and he that is filthy, let him be filthie still; and hee that is righteous, let him be righteous still; and he that is holy, let him be holy still. And behold, I come shortly, and my reward is with mee, to giue to euery man as his worke shall be.</hi>
