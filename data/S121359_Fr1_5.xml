   <head>HENRIE STEPHEN TO THE READER.</head>
   <p>
      <hi>
         <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HVCYDIDES</hi> in the Preface to his historie, hath an excellent saying worthy our serious consideration, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching vs to condemne that in our selues, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes in the auncient <hi>Grecians,</hi> for speaking vainly of sundry accidents which fell out before their time, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their beliefe vpon an vncertaine brute blazed abroad without taking further paines to search thereinto: which was the cause they so often entertained falshood in stead of the truth. Which should teach vs to bridle our leuitie, as often as we are drawne to credit any report, especially in matters of importance. But this euill hath made so deepe impression in many mens mindes, that before it can be beaten out of them, I feare me, they must be cast in a new mould. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, the reasons hereof are different, for the cause of some mens ouer-great incredulitie, is weaknesse, and want of iudgement, in that they are not able to discusse what they heare. The ouer-light beliefe of others proceedeth from hence, in that they neglect, at leastwise do not seriously consider what is said, but relie more vpon the authoritie of the speaker, then the truth of that which is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, according to that of <hi>Euripides:</hi>
      <q>
         <l>In rich mens mouthes the sentence of the poore,</l>
         <l>Soundeth alike (perhaps) but weigheth more.</l>
      </q>
Which common experience proues true in those who are wont to say, <hi>I beleeue it, for I heard it of such a Gentleman, or such a Lord, or</hi> (to expresse <hi>Euripides</hi> his owne terme) <hi>of such a man of credite and account.</hi> Seeing then this ouer-great credulitie entertaineth all reports alike without iudgement or discretion, to exemplifie eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie branch in particular, would be a thing not onely tedious, but euen endlesse, and such as would neither be pleasant nor profitable to the Reader. I will therefore content my selfe with the relation of one of them, which may serue as an intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to the argument I haue here vndertaken to intreate of.</p>
   <p>First therefore I will begin with the rashnesse of certaine critickes in censuring the writings of ancient authors, which as it is now growne farre greater then euer it was in former time, so the leuitie of others in beleeuing their censures, was neuer so great. Indeed some of these selfe-conceited censurers, who haue not lost all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie, shoot their bolts in priuate only among their friends: others suffering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be transported with presumption and vaineglory, not herewith content, publish them in print, to the view of the world. Wherof we haue an example in an <hi>Italian,</hi> whose iudgment (or censure) of certain <hi>Latin</hi> Poets, if it were true, he only among all the students of Poets and Poetrie for these diuers hundred yeares, was sharp sighted and Eagle eyed, the rest as blind as Moles &amp; Beetles. And what (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you) say these credulous men herupon? Such &amp; such a one (as I take it) is no such good Poet. And why Sir, I bseech you? Because (forsooth) such a learned and
<pb n="2" facs="11"/>
famous writer saith so. In like manner, we haue heard of some within these few yeares, who haue held strange opinions of <hi>Latin</hi> authors: some giuing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence (for a pure and elegant stile) to three; others to one onely. For some make a <hi>triumuirate</hi> of <hi>Terence, Cicero</hi> and <hi>Caesar.</hi> Others make <hi>Cicero</hi> the Prince or rather monarch and soueraigne Lord of all the Latinists. And then God knowes how finely they who alledge no other reason then the authoritie of such iolly iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges come in with their <hi>I beleeue.</hi> In spite of all which, there was a bold <hi>Brittan</hi> who proscribed <hi>Cicero</hi> with all his eloquence to perpetuall banishment. Howbeit, he was straight recalled by another of greater account. See here (gentle Reader) how these learned <hi>Latin</hi> authors haue bene trounced by these dangerously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited and proud presumptuous censurers. But what shall we say of <hi>Greeke</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors? Are they exempt from the sharpe censure of such critickes? No verily. For this worshipful writer of whom I haue spoken, spareth the <hi>Greeke</hi> writers no more then the <hi>Latin.</hi> And who knowes not, how that famous and thrise renowned <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle,</hi> with all his Philosophie, hath bene scourged by a pedant of <hi>Paris?</hi>
   </p>
   <p>But to come somewhat nearer to <hi>Herodotus</hi> (the author of whom I am to speake) I will here enter discourse as well of <hi>Greeke</hi> as of <hi>Latine</hi> Historiographers, seeing they are the men who are most read and perused by all sorts of censurers, by reason of their translations. What historian then is there extant at this day, on whom these hastie hot-spurres spend not some by-words and taunting quips? As when they say, <hi>Herodotus doth nothing but lie. Thucydides can pen an oration pretily wel, and that is all. Xenophon is not like himselfe in his history.</hi>
And some shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues yet more ridiculous in giuing peremptorie iudgment of the style of the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian by the translation; as when they say, <q>
         <hi>Thucydides</hi> hath no such graue and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite stile as some affirme him to haue: for a man can see no such thing neither in the <hi>Latin, French,</hi> nor any other translation.</q>
These men (me thinkes) speake to as great purpose, and with as good reason, as if a man should guesse at the beautie of one long before departed, by his skull taken out of the charnel-house: or as if one seeing a sicke man, reported to haue bene very faire and beautifull, of a vermilion hue, and ruddie as a rose (as we commonly speake when we would expresse a faire complexion) should call the truth of that report into question, or should affirme it to be as false as contradiction can make it onely vpon a silly supposall and meere imagination, that if there had bin any such thing, either the lineaments of his fine feature, or some rayes and relikes of that vermilion tincture would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine to be seene. If any shall here aske me, why I make choise of this compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and deliuer my notion rather in this then in any other allusion: I answer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I find none so fit nor pertinent to my purpose: for I dare confidently affirme, that the greatest part of <hi>Greeke</hi> writers, who in their owne language are sound and succulent, and of such excellent forme and feature, colour and tincture, that the beames of their beauty do draw vs into an admiration of them, and are (as it were) an allectiue to make vs in loue with them: look very sickly, as being much shrunk, and almost disfigured in <hi>French, Italian, Spanish,</hi> and other languages, by reason of the bad entertainment they haue found by the way. That is (to speake plainely without allegorizing) that the greatest part (especially of <hi>Greeke</hi> authors) who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing read in their owne language by such as vnderstand them, haue excellent good grace, and do not onely please the eare, but euen rauish the mind with delight, are so poorely and pitifully translated into <hi>French, Spanish</hi> and <hi>Italian,</hi> that a man shall find as great difference betweene the originall Greek and their translations, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a body in perfect health, and the same when after a long &amp; lingring sicknes
<pb n="3" facs="11"/>
it is ready to giue vp the ghost. And from whence (I beseech you) cometh this, but onely from hence, that they which translated them into their mother tongue haue bene translators of translators, that is to say, haue translated them out of the <hi>Latin</hi> translation; and hauing no knowledge in the <hi>Greeke,</hi> haue not onely retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the errors of these translations, but often mistaking euen them also, haue fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into sundry other more grosse and palpable. Whereof I haue giuen some few examples in my <hi>Thucydides,</hi> shewing how <hi>Laurentius Valla</hi> hath guessed, and (as it were) deuined at <hi>Thucydides</hi> his meaning: as also how the <hi>French</hi> translator <hi>Claudius de Seyssel</hi> bishop of <hi>Marse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>le</hi> hath guessed at <hi>Vallas</hi> translation. But as <hi>Valla</hi> did much mistake the meaning of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> so <hi>Claudius de Seyssel</hi> did guesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse at <hi>Laurentius</hi> his meaning. So that looke how much the number of those is greater, which haue bene wronged in this kind (which is more truly verified of <hi>Thucydides</hi> and <hi>Herodotus</hi> then of any other,) so much is <hi>Plutarch</hi> the more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to two learned translators, who to array him in <hi>French,</hi> haue onely chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his garment and attire. Whereas these tinkerly translators (of whom I haue spoken) change not onely the authors attire, but put him also into another fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion.</p>
   <p>But to returne to those who iudge not of authors by their translations, but by a certaine notion which they haue of their phrase and idiome. Verily such cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers are rather to be regarded, as not being so impudent as the former: nor yet like <hi>Rabbi Beda,</hi> who to the end he might auert king <hi>Francis</hi> the first from his most noble and princely resolution touching the establishing of professors of the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, alleaged in the presence of the now deceassed <hi>M. Budé</hi> against the <hi>Greeke,</hi> that it was the fountaine of all heresies; whereas he (on the contrary) encouraged the King by all possible meanes to go forward with that so worthy a worke. But after it was once knowne that <hi>Beda</hi> condemned a language whereof he scarce knew the first letter, he was condemned of all for a very bedlem. Those (I say) which rely vpon some smattering knowledge they haue of the language, are not in the same degree of impudencie with the former; notwithstanding they shew that they haue eaten too much of the criticall creame, when they censure a whole worke because they vnderstand some part thereof. But that we may the lesse won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at this rashnesse, we must remember an excellent saying of the foresaid <hi>Thucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides, There are none so bold as these blind bayards.</hi> The reason is plaine, because they cannot so well foresee the difficulties which they are to encounter with, as those who haue waded through them. And verily this prouerbiall sentence is verified at this day in all bold and rash aduenturers, but especially in such as take vpon them to censure classike authors, a thing as well dangerous as odious. How euer it be, certaine it is that they who for their sufficiencie might best play the <hi>Aristarchi,</hi> and thereby purchase to themselues immortall fame, do least of all others inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle therewith.</p>
   <p>But to descend to particulars: if the common prouerbe, <hi>A fooles bolt is soone shot,</hi> was euer verified in <hi>Greeke</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi> writer, it may be truly said of <hi>Herodotus</hi> aboue the rest: for he (poore author) is euer brought vpon the stage, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap> onely by such as haue read him rather in a strange language then in his owne; but euen by those who haue not read so much as one line or letter in him, but are altogether ignorant of the very inscription and title of his historie. How then (may some say) do they sentence and censure him? Verily by following the example of others, who (it may be) know nothing but by hearesay neither. But leauing such censori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sirs, I come to those who ground not their opinion vpon so sandie a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
<pb n="4" facs="12"/>
but seeme to be able to iustifie what they affirme. I demaund then, what reason they haue to condemne his histories as false and fabulous? Will they say, they know them better then the author himselfe? They are not (I hope) so deuoid of shame. Why then do they suspect them? Because (forsooth) they haue no shew nor semblance of truth. Consider here (gentle Reader) how Logically they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, when they inferre, that therefore they are not true, because they seeme to be false.</p>
   <p>But this is not all I haue to say: for I further deny that to be true which they take as granted and already proued, viz. that these histories haue neither substance nor shadow of truth in them. Yet admit it were so: whereon (I beseech you) do they ground their opinion? Verily vpon these two reasons. First, the exceeding great impietie which is to be seene in some particulars described by <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and the extreme folly which bewrayeth it selfe in othersome seeme to them alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether incredible. Secondly considering that most of that which we reade in his history, hath no correspondence to the customes and fashions of these times, they suppose auncient stories to be as dissonant from truth, as they are from that which they dayly heare and see. The former of which two reasons, branching forth into two stemmes or heads, I haue encountred before: for doubtlesse we shal find some as notorious facts as any mentioned in <hi>Herodotus,</hi> which we cannot but beleeue as hauing bene eye-witnesses therof. The like I affirme of the sottishnesse of those times. For though it may seeme incredible to some, yet I doubt not but if it be compared with the simplicitie of our late forefathers, it will be found but as a mole-hill in comparison of a mountaine, or a dwarfe of a giant. I am not ignorant how the poore <hi>Aegyptians</hi> in <hi>Herodotus</hi> are derided and laughed to scorne for their religion (if it may be so called) and deseruedly I confesse, as may appeare by their exceeding trifling ceremonies. But if we come to the superstitious Masse-priests, which haue bene within these threescore yeares, and narrowly search all their trash and trinkets, we shal be (in a maner) enforced to confesse, that the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> might (in comparison) euen glorie and boast of their religion. I say <hi>in comparison,</hi> as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of two euils to point at the lesse. Notwithstanding lest any man should say that I speake of the last yeares snow, I will come to that which is plaine &amp; manifest to all that haue their eyes in their heads. O (will some say) what great fooles were these <hi>Aegyptians</hi> to worship bruite beasts! I confesse they were great fooles indeed; yet so, as that they also confesse, that worshippers of liuelesse creatures are greater fooles then those that worship liuing creatures. Which being granted, the Masse-priests cake is all dough. For they worship both dead and liuelesse things. And of those things which neuer had life or sense, not only creatures of account, but euen vile and base things, as not onely siluer and gold, but wood and stone also. For if they did prostrate themselues onely before gold or siluer, their worship would be somewhat more honorable: (as the heathen when they would haue a god carying some maiestie with him, framed him of one of these two mettals.) And they might alledge that <hi>Iupiter</hi> transformed himselfe into a showre of gold. As also that in all ages (euen in those countries where Images were not in vse) couetous men haue worshipped these mettals as their gods: which cannot be said of wood and stone. Howbeit we haue a story in this author, which shewes what disgrace may befall the worshippers of gold and siluer, as well as of wood and stone. For we reade how that <hi>Amasis</hi> of a golden bason (wherein he was accustomed to wash his feet) made a god. And why might he not as well make a bason or chamber-pot of his god, as a god of his bason? But I leaue it to the Readers consideration, what a
<pb n="5" facs="12"/>
griefe and shame it ought to be to a man to see that, before which he hath prostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himselfe, conuerted to so base and sordide vses as cannot once be named with modestie. And here doubtlesse the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> would alledge for themselues, that their worship being directed to, and terminated in liuing creatures (though they had pictures also and grauen images) was not liable to such disgrace and infamie. I omit such reasons as common sence leadeth vs vnto, to preferre a liuing thing (whatsoeuer it be) before that which is voide of life, or which neuer had life, and come to the other point, viz. that as the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> were not so sottish in their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, neither were they so foolish in defending it. And therefore that which <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus Siculus</hi> reporteth of the <hi>Alexandrians,</hi> who would not pardon a <hi>Romaine</hi> for killing one of their cats, is more excusable and tollerable then the dealings of our Masse-mongers (whereof we haue bene eye-witnesses) when they cruelly massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred those that maimed their Images. For a liuing creature maimed in some mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, is hindered of the natural motion whereof that member is an instrument. But doth he (I beseech you) that cutteth off the legges of an Image, depriue it of wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king? or doth he that puts out the eyes of it (if I may so speake) bereaue it of sight? And yet the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> neuer tooke such cruell reuenge vpon any for killing their cats, as they haue done of late time in wrecking their malice vpon such as maimed any of their marmousets or puppets.</p>
   <p>But sith the comparison standeth betweene these two follies, whether should be the greater, and that all Masse-mongers do not worship Images, we will come to that which all the professors of that religion generally worship, which is their great goddesse <hi>Diana,</hi> the pillar (as it were) of Popery, &amp; the foundation of all their foolery, which they maintaine with fire and sword: let vs therefore weigh without partialitie or passion, what we wold think or say if <hi>Herodotus</hi> or some other ancient historian should tell vs, that men in certaine countries were <hi>Theophages</hi> (that is, God-eaters) as they report of <hi>Anthropophages, Elephantophages, Acridophages, Phthirophages,</hi> and such like; would we not straight say, that this <hi>Theophagie</hi> were incredible, and that these fablers deuised it of their fingers, and fathered it vpon them, though otherwise most barbarous? Notwithstanding we dayly heare certaine report of these <hi>Theophages</hi>; nay (which is more) of <hi>Theochezes.</hi> What say I, report? seeing we dwell in the same countries, townes, and houses with them? Concerning other mysteries as wel <hi>Morological</hi> as <hi>Hyperbadinomorological,</hi> which accompanie this <hi>Theophagie,</hi> I leaue them to the discretion of the Reader, from whose eyes God of his goodnesse hath remoued the veile of superstition: not doubting but that when he hath well weighed them, he will confesse with me, that in comparison of them, there is nothing base in the religion of the <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> I meane in their superstitious ceremonies, which they otherwise call Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
   <p>The second thing that crackes the credite of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> is, in that we reade sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry particulars in his historie, which sute not with the fashions of these times. For some there be (as hath bene said) who neuer obseruing the great alteration that is to be seene almost in all things since those dayes, would haue the disposition, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes and manners of our ancesters so to sute and iumpe with ours point-deuice, that nothing could please<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="2 letters">
         <desc>••</desc>
      </gap> them but what pleaseth vs. And not so onely, but would find a correspondence betweene the States of common-wealths, king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and gouernments of those times with these of ours. Nay, some in reading of auncient histories go yet a step further, in measuring the climats of forreine and far remote regions by their owne, such simple soules they are. And for conclusion
<pb n="6" facs="13"/>
they alledge diuers reasons, for which sundry things related by <hi>Herodotus</hi> seeme improbable at the least. Well, be it so: yet what Logicke teacheth vs such a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent? It is not probable, therfore it is false. If this were a good argument, nothing would seeme either strange or wonderfull. For what do we vse to wonder at, but at that which falleth out against our expectation or opinion? that is, at that which we find to be true, and yet seemeth to be false, because it is not vsuall, or aboue our reach, or against reason; I meane our mentall discourse grounded vpon such or such reasons. In the meane time consider whether this be not to tyrannize ouer historians, to subiect them (as it were) to this seruitude and slauery, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port nothing but what we shall thinke probable, for feare of being accounted ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fabulous, and dreaming fellowes.</p>
   <p>But it will be more expedient (in my iudgement) to instance this by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. <hi>Herodotus</hi> therefore reporteth very strange things I confesse: and moreouer affirme, that they are of two sorts. For in some of his histories we admire the works of nature: in other some we wonder at the actions of men; and not so onely, but hold them altogether incredible. First then we may not thinke any thing incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible in nature, if we consider the almightie power of the author and gouernour of nature. It were inough to make vs all at our wits end, if we should see the Sunne stay his course and stand stil in the firmament: and who would not say that it were cleane against the order of nature? Notwithstanding we haue such authenticall proofe herof, that we cannot once cal it into question. True it is, nature now a daies produceth neither Giants nor Pigmes: doth it therefore follow, that it neuer brought forth such? Touching Giants, the Scripture giueth sufficient testimonie: and dead mens bones may well induce vs to beleeue there haue bene such. And Pigmes (as authors haue described them) were not much differing from the dwarfes and elfes we dayly see. Men at this day liue not ordinarily aboue 80. or 90. yeares: and yet we dare not denie but that some (not to speake of <hi>Methuselah</hi>) haue liued sixe or seuen ages longer. And besides those mentioned in the holy writ, we find that many (long since their time) haue liued so exceeding long (though not so long as those mentioned in Scripture) that there is no compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son betweene their yeares and ours. Women at this day go but nine moneths for the most part: and therefore <hi>Herodotus</hi> must be sent packing with his ten mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths. See how easie a matter it is for those who credit the common report (which hath often a blister on her tongue) to condemne <hi>Herodotus</hi> as a fabulous fellow and lying Legendary. But let vs see how many authors they here encounter. For if <hi>Herodotus</hi> must not be heard with his ten moneths, neither must <hi>Hippocrates, Galen, Plutarch, Plinie,</hi> sundry lawyers, nor the greatest part of Poets, as <hi>Theocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Plautus, Cecilius, Virgil</hi> and <hi>Propertius,</hi> who affirme as much. But certaine it is, that they which condemne <hi>Herodotus</hi> in this particular, either haue not read him, or do not remember that they haue read as much in these writers; and being fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalled with this preiudicate opinion, that he maketh no conscience of a lie, they scorne any further information; to which if they would but lend a patient eare, they should (without forraging so farre) find the like, nay some farre greater and more wonderfull things in the extraordinary workes of nature then any mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by him. For clearing of which point, I wil adde an obiection of another kind. That which he reporteth of the fertility of the territory of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that one graine yeeldeth for the most part two hundred and oftentimes three hundred, farre sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passeth the fruitfulnesse of our soyle, and therefore (say they) it is out of question he here lied for the whetstone. But let these horned Logicians which frame such
<pb n="7" facs="13"/>
crooked arguments, answer whether nature can bring foorth fruite any more of her selfe, then the knife can cut of it selfe? They will answer (I am sure) that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. I demaund then, what is that ouer-ruling hand which guideth and disposeth all these things? They dare not denie but that it is Omnipotent▪ which if they grant, why should they thinke that to be impossible to him, which is here affirmed by <hi>Herodotus?</hi> If they shall further say, that he and other historians tell vs strange tales of the fertilitie of certaine countries, whose plentie consisteth at this day only in scarcitie, want and penurie, and hereupon shall accuse him of forgerie; let them beware lest they inuolue the holy scriptures in the same accusation. For they make some places fertile, which are now in a maner barren. But if we consider the hand, which somtimes stretcheth forth it self, and somtimes drawes it self in again, which now sendeth forth a blessing, and now a curse vpon one and the same country. In briefe, if we call to mind the saying of <hi>Dauid,</hi> Psal. 104. and refer the reason of such alterations to that supreame and soueraigne cause, we shall find the true answer to such obiections. Moreouer, those who for the former reason will not beleeue <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus</hi> his report of the fruitfulnesse of <hi>Babylon,</hi> will neuer beeleue that the citie <hi>Babylon</hi> was so great as he reporteth it to haue bene, viz. that those which dwelt in the suburbes were surprised and taken before they in the heart of the citie had knowledge thereof. For if we measure the largenesse of it by the greatnesse of our cities, it cannot chuse but seeme false and fabulous.</p>
   <p>I proceed now to prosecute the second part, touching the actions of men. First then as <hi>Herodotus</hi> is suspected of falshood and forgery, for reporting that <hi>Babylon</hi> was so beautiful, great &amp; rich, and situate in so fertil a soile: so is he also for the large report which he maketh of the puissance of the <hi>Persian</hi> Kings, Lords of that citie. For who can beleeue that a King of <hi>Persia</hi> euer led such an armie as drunke riuers drie? I meane such small riuers as he speaketh of. True it is (I confesse) if the Reader shal consider the power of our moderne Kings, and thereby iudge of the puissance and power of the <hi>Persian</hi> Monarchs, he cannot but hold <hi>Herodotus</hi> for the fondest fabler that euer writ. But to make this comparison, were to demaund (as one did) whether the Sea were greater then the Lake of <hi>New-castle:</hi> and it were to speake with as good iudgement as he that said (as it is reported) <hi>Se le Rey de Franse se fousse bin gouuerna, è fousse maitre d'houta de n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>.</hi> It were (I say) to measure the power of Princes with his mete-wand, who said, <hi>Mo, l'è pur matto'sto ré, à <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

         </gap>uffar con san Marco. L'è perso, che i signori ha deliberato di mettere in terra cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quecenti cauai fottili.</hi> For looke how much these fond fooles debased the King of <hi>France</hi> by such ignorant and doltish speeches: so much do they decase the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> who compare him with our moderne Kings. But as he which asked whether the Sea were greater then the Lake of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> would neuer haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded this question if he had seene <hi>Danubius</hi> or <hi>Nilus,</hi> but wold (at least should) haue gathered, that if these riuers do incomparably exceed this Lake in bignesse, the Sea (into which all riuers do run) must needs be of a huge and spacious great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: so he that hath but read what forces <hi>Tamberlaine</hi> leuied of late yeares in comparison (being at the first but a Neatheard) will (no doubt) if he haue but a dramme of iudgement thereby gather, that the power of the <hi>Persian</hi> Kings did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely surpasse the forces of our moderne Kings. For <hi>Tamberlaine</hi> had sixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand footmen and foure hundred thousand horsemen when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred <hi>Baiazet</hi> the <hi>Turkish</hi> Emperour; and hauing discomfited two hundred thousand of his men, led him away prisoner in fetters of gold. Now then if <hi>Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine</hi> of a neatheard became so puissant a Prince, to what height (may we think)
<pb n="8" facs="14"/>
mounted the Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> considering that euen from their cradles they were men of matchlesse might, which at their dying day they left much more increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed? For confirmation whereof, though many pregnant proofes might be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, yet I will content my selfe with such as historians do affoord, as namely how <hi>Xerxes</hi> (one of these Emperours) gaue to <hi>Themistocles</hi> fiue great cities, the first for his pantry, the second for his celler, the third for his kitchin, the fourth for his wardrobe, and the fift for his bed-chamber. And what great thing was this for the King of <hi>Persia</hi> to giue? Verily no more then for a King at this day to giue one or two small villages.</p>
   <p>They further affirme, that it is not probable that euer any King should play such prankes as <hi>Herodotus</hi> reporteth, not onely not beseeming their places and persons (being Princes) but any simple swaines or corridons of the countrey. Whereunto I answer, that if it were a new thing to see Kings commit facts vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming their places and persons, we might well suspect his report in this behalfe. But if it be common and ordinary in euery childs mouth, why should we not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it? What (may some say) is it credible that a King should so farre forget him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, as to expose his naked wife to the view of his seruant, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> affirmeth of King <hi>Candaules?</hi> To which I answer, that if <hi>Candaules</hi> were the onely King that played so shamefull a part, we were in some sort to be pardoned, if we did not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe hereto; (though other as vile parts and practises of theirs might induce vs to beleeue it) but when we finde in other vndoubted histories that Kings haue done the like, why should not his testimonie go for currant with vs? Nay, we reade of some who haue not onely committed the selfe same fact, but others also farre worse. Albeit my memory furnisheth me onely with two examples at this present. The first is of one who committed the very same: The second, of another who did wel worse. For the first, consider what <hi>Suetonius</hi> writeth in the life of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligula,</hi> where he discourseth of that which this King (or Emperour as the <hi>Romanes</hi> speake) did to his wife <hi>Cesonia, Vt sape chlamyde, pelta{que} &amp; galeâ armatam, &amp; iuxta adequitantem, militibus ostenderit, amicis verò etiam nudam.</hi> Yea but <hi>Caligula</hi> was a man giuen ouer to all kind of villanie. And what then? as though <hi>Candaules</hi> was not as very a villaine as he? For the second, consider how a King (not registred among the rest as famous, or rather infamous for his villanies) hath committed a farre more shameful fact then the shewing of his naked wife. For <hi>Baptista Fulgosius</hi> reporteth how that <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Castile,</hi> sonne to king <hi>Iohn,</hi> being frigide and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to get children, had one by the helpe of a goodly yong man of the countrey, one <hi>Beltramus Cueua.</hi> As who so will not credite my report, may reade in the third chapter of the ninth booke of the said <hi>Fulgosius.</hi> And it is further to be noted, that he did not this in heate of affection, in some sodaine moode or passion, but after long and mature deliberation, hauing aduanced him from the bottome of base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to the height of honor, from the dunghill euen to a Dukedome, to the end he might the last draw from▪ him this seruice in recompence of so many bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites. And if I were disposed to speake of priuate men, I could alledge examples of sundry sages, possessed with this Kings humour, cosingermans to that wittall, who is so famous by these verses of <hi>Iuuenal,</hi>
      <q>
         <l>—doctus spectare lacunar,</l>
         <l>Doctus &amp; ad calicem vigilanti stertere naso.</l>
      </q>
But among other stories impugned by many, and reckoned in the number of ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous tales, that is not to be forgotten which is recorded in his first booke, of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that came to King <hi>Cresus,</hi> requesting him they might haue his sons company
<pb n="9" facs="14"/>
to assist them in taking a great wilde Boare which wasted the countrey. See (say they) a sine fable, and easie to be beleeued, that a Kings sonne should be intreated to performe such an exploit. Verily if this historie were to be examined by the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome at this day, I grant they had reason thus to except. For example, in the yeare 1548. when a cat of mount which came out of the forrest of <hi>Orleans</hi> did infinitely endamage the country of <hi>Berry</hi> (as another beast had done elsewhere in the yeare 1546.) the inhabitants were farre from requesting the King of <hi>France</hi> his sonne (though he had bene of yeares) to helpe them. But if we consider (as we ought) that Kings in those dayes were exceeding iealous of their honour in performing brauer exploits in hunting (especially in striking fierce and furious beasts) then any of their subiects, we shall haue no cause to thinke this history strange. Now that they were indeed iealous hereof, in such sort as hath bene said, may appeare by that which <hi>Ctesias, Xenophon,</hi> and <hi>Herodotus</hi> also (as I remember) report hereof, viz. how they put some of their huntsmen to death for striking the beast they had in chase, and so depriuing them of that honour which (as they thought) was due to none but to themselues. But leauing the further prosecuting of this point, we vnderstand by this story what great desire they had to become famous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned for their prowesse and actiuitie.</p>
   <p>I haue likewise heard the story of the Magician who fained himselfe King of <hi>Persia,</hi> and for seuen moneths was reputed for no lesse, accounted fabulous. For is it likely (say they) that this counterfeit should not haue bene discouered in so long time? To which I answer, that we haue sundry examples of this kind of cosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage (as I haue shewed in my Latin Apologie) where I haue alledged two notable examples of the like imposture, viz. of such as haue enioyed the name and roome of those whō they counterfeited, as though they had bene the parties themselues, which in all reason ought not so easily to be credited: and yet are so authentically verified, that we cannot doubt thereof. One is of dame <hi>Ioane</hi> (the she Pope) who was held for Pope <hi>Iohn,</hi> till that a butterflie came out of her belly. The other is of one <hi>Arnold du Tilh,</hi> who played the cunning counterfeit so well, that he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and receiued as husband to the wife of one <hi>Martin Guerre,</hi> who was then absent, keeping her companie both at bed and boord as though he had bene her true husband, for the space of three yeares and more, during which time he had certaine children by her: neither she nor any of her kinred and friends euer dreaming that she had companied with any saue her own husband. But in the end her true husband returning home (but not knowne) commenced sute in the court of Parliament at <hi>Thoulouse</hi> against this <hi>Arnold,</hi> who disturbed him so grieuously in his possession in the yeare 1559. as is to be seene in that strange manner of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding afterwards published in print.</p>
   <p>Touching the different dispositions and behauiours of men in sundry coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries described by <hi>Herodotus,</hi> it is strange they should be found so strange as not to be beleeued; especially considering the difference and dissimilitude which is to be seene betweene vs and our neare neighbors, as also the continuall strange alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of customes and fashions in one &amp; the same country. For as for the difference betwixt vs and our next neighbours, who sees not, how in their manner of life, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and ordinary affaires, they haue nothing common with vs? If we should see a a man of worth in <hi>France,</hi> apparelled in greene, we would surely thinke he were somewhat fantasticall: whereas in many places of <hi>Germany</hi> this attire is generally approued of all as decent and seemly. Againe, if we should see a woman in <hi>France</hi> weare a gowne of diuers colours with broade guards, we would thinke she meant
<pb n="10" facs="15"/>
to come vpon the stage, or that she did it for a wager: whereas in that countrey they hold this kind of attire very ciuill. Further, we in <hi>France</hi> (and others also in other countries) would haue a hard conceit of a woman that should go vp and downe the streets with her breast laid open, shewing halfe her dugges: whereas in some places of <hi>Italie</hi> (especially at <hi>Venice</hi>) not so much as old filthy hanging dugs but are set out (as it were) to shew and sale. Moreouer, in <hi>France</hi> and elsewhere women go to market to buy their prouision: whereas in <hi>Italie</hi> their husbands go themselues, keeping their wiues mewed vp as it were in a cage. Furthermore, kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in <hi>France</hi> betweene gentlemen and gentlewomen, &amp;c. is permitted and held as honest, be they kinsmen or others: whereas such a kisse in <hi>Italie</hi> would not only be scandalous, but also dangerous. In recompence whereof, <hi>Italian</hi> dames make no conscience to paint themselues as <hi>French</hi> Ladies do, those at leastwise that are not <hi>Italianized.</hi> These few examples (which may serue vs as a patterne of that which hereafter (God willing) shal be handled more at large) shall suffice for this present: and herewith I will conclude, that if in so neare neighbouring nations, and in the same age, the manners of men are so dissonant and disagreeing one from another, we may not imagine the difference betweene vs and those of whom <hi>Herodotus</hi> speaketh so incredible, they being so farre remote from vs, not onely in distance of place, but also of time. But because the difference betweene our customes and those of our predecessors may easily be discerned, I spare examples.</p>
   <p>Yet one thing further is to be noted, viz. that some which at the first blush may haply seeme foolish and ridiculous (and are therefore thought forged and fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous) if they be throughly considered, will be found to be grounded vpon good reason.
Among the rest, that of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> recorded in the first booke may well be numbred. <q>In euery market towne (saith he) once a yeare they assemble all the mariageable maides, and leade them to a certaine place appointed for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, where a multitude of men come flocking about them: and there they are sold by an officer to him that offereth most, the fairest of all being cried first, and she being sold at a high rate, the next to her in beautie, and so the rest in order; yet vpon condition that they marry them and take them for their wiues. Whereupon the richest <hi>Babylonians</hi> intending to marry, but the fairest and most beautifull vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins in the company, one out-bidding another in the bargain. The country swains contenting themselues though they haue not the fairest, take the woodden-fac'd wenches, and the ill-fauourd-foule-fustilugs for a small summe. For when the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer hath sold all the handsomest, he comes to the foulest of them all (her especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that is lame, or hath but one eye, or some such deformitie) and cries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud, <hi>Who will haue her for such a price?</hi> In the end she is deliuered to him that will be content to marry her for the smallest summe. The mony which is giuen for the mariage of the foulest, acrewing of the sale of the fairest. And thus the faire marry the foule, and such as haue any bodily blemish or imperfection. Neither is it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for any to giue his daughter to whom he thinkes good; nor for him which hath bought her, to carry her away before he hath giuen his word that he will marry her.</q>
This story at the first sight seemeth not onely strange, but also ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: howbeit if we consider the causes and inducements which moued the <hi>Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi> to marry their daughters in this sort, we shall find that there is more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and lesse sin in this custome, then in sundry lawes deuised by those great Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>Now as it cannot be denied but that there are in <hi>Herodotus</hi> sundry customes and fashions, both wilde and wicked, which for this cause carry small credite with
<pb n="11" facs="15"/>
them: so must it needs be granted that he recordeth many noble enterprises, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous acts and valiant exploits, vndertaken, managed and atchieued with such cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, prowesse and valour, as may well deserue admiration. And that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
         <desc>•</desc>
      </gap>his history so abhorring from truth or so incredible, but may winne cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence if we compare it with that which other historians haue written in the like kinde. For they report farre stranger facts, I meane such as were atchieued with infinite greater prowesse and valour. And verily since the first inuention of guns it was necessary men should (as it were) double and treble their valour, in expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing themselues against their mercilesse fury and rage. And we haue dayly euents and occurrences which do in a maner compel vs to beleeue that to be true, which before we held to be false. The fact of <hi>Cocles</hi> alwayes thought so strange and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, was confirmed Anno 1562. by a Scot, who being pursued by certaine Reisters (from whom he could not wind himselfe) leapt with his horse from the top of the mountaine <hi>Caux</hi> (neare to <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> called <hi>Hable</hi>) into the Sea, and so escaped safe to land: which is a story confirmed by innumerable testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</p>
   <p>I am further to aduertise thee (gentle Reader) that some stories recorded by <hi>Herodotus,</hi> which seeme very strange, and which a man would think were written for the whetstone, are confirmed not onely by the testimonies of approued later writers, but of our moderne historians, as I haue shewed in my Latine Apology. Of which number that of the women of <hi>Thrace</hi> may wel be reckoned, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended when their husband was dead (for one man had many wiues) which of them should die with him for companie. For each of them affirmed that they were best beloued: and thereupon great suite was made by their kinsfolkes and friends, that they might haue the honour to accompanie him at his death. For she that was thus graced, was accounted happie, the rest going away with shame enough all their liues after. Verily this history cannot be sampled nor paralelled by any example of women in these countries: for euen those kind hearts which loue their husbands best, would looke strangely vpon him that should aske them whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they could not be contented to lay downe their liues for their husbands▪ as <hi>Alcestis</hi> did, (a fact grounded vpon better reason then that of the <hi>Thracians.</hi>) And I perswade my selfe they would aske so many three dayes respite, and so many termes to answer in one after another, that there would be no end. But shall we therefore say it is a fiction? For my part, though there were none but onely <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi> that affirmed it, I would not hold it incredible, considering what <hi>Caesar</hi> and other auncient historians write of those which suffered voluntary death with the Kings of <hi>Aquitane.</hi> For the King of that countrey (saith he) had six hundred men with him, whom he entertained in his Court, permitting them to haue a hand in managing the affaires of the State, vpon condition they should beare him compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie at his death: which (without further intreatie) they were readie to performe. This history (I say) maketh the other much more credible. But to omit this known example, we find this very thing which <hi>Herodotus</hi> reports of these <hi>Thracians,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by other historiographers, who (as we know) neuer tooke it out of him: and testified also by others who were eye-witnesses thereof: albeit they report it of the <hi>Indians</hi> and not of the <hi>Thracians.</hi>
   </p>
   <p>I further affirme that our moderne historians report some stranger things then any is to be found in <hi>Herodotus,</hi> which hath purchased him so ill a name; which notwithstanding go for currant from hand to hand, because the authors thereof are men of credit and account. Those especially which write of barbarous coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
<pb n="12" facs="16"/>
tell vs certaine strange stories, farre surpassing any in <hi>Herodotus.</hi> I meane such strange wonders as are to be seene in the workes of nature, and the actions of mens liues, as well in their manners as dispositions. Whereof we haue examples in those who haue written of <hi>Muscouy</hi> (in auncient time called <hi>Scythia</hi>) especially in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gismundus Liber</hi>; who discoursing of strange humours and dispositions, hath one thing amongst the rest which is more then incredible. And though all men should subscribe vnto it, yet I see not how any woman could be brought to credit it: and yet he speaketh nothing but vpon good euidence. It is of a woman borne in a countrey bordering vpon <hi>Muscouy,</hi> who though her husband entertained her in the kindest melting maner that might be, yet perswaded her selfe he cared not for her. Whereupon he demaunding on a time what reason she had to thinke so? she answered, because he shewed not the true tokens of his loue. He then reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting her to expound her meaning: How (quoth she) can you say you loue me, sith since the time we came first together you did neuer beate me? He wondering at this so strange a humour and extraordinary desire, promised to giue her her bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie full. Which when he had done, both parties tooke greater contentment then euer before: for she found her selfe well by being beaten, and he by beating of her. For where as it is said, that <hi>the cudgell marres loue,</hi> the cudgell made loue. And thus he kindly entertained her for a long time. Howbeit in the end he entertained her so exceeding kindly with blowes, that he killed her with kindnesse, causing loue and life to giue their last farewell.</p>
   <p>There remaine yet other things to be spoken concerning <hi>Herodotus</hi>; but it shall suffice that they haue bin discussed in my <hi>Latin</hi> Apologie. And here I wil take my leaue of thee (gentle Reader) onely desiring thee to hold me excused if haply thou find any thing slubbered vp or posted ouer. For as touching my rude and vnpoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed stile, and abuse of certaine termes, besides that the great varietie of matter might excuse me (the bare contriuing whereof would haue required greater lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure) I hope my profession will pleade for me: for it distracted my mind, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained me to deuide the same halfe houre to the studie of the <hi>Greeke, Latine</hi> and <hi>French.</hi> But I will confesse mine ignorance, that I know not where a man may furnish himselfe with such a <hi>French</hi> phrase as may go for currant in all places, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the best <hi>French</hi> words are dayly reiected and cried downe by our new mint-masters, who though they thinke they vse a fine filed phrase, and speake in print after the Court fashion, yet speake harshly &amp; barbarously in the iudgement of the sager and soberer sort who retaine the ancient phrase of speech. True it is (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse) I haue here coined some new words, howbeit very sparingly, there onely where the auncient failed, and such as any man may perceiue I haue forged of pleasure, that I might speake ridiculously of ridiculous things, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing through the simplicitie of some silly soules are accounted very serious. And albeit (gentle Reader) I am not ignorant that it will be thought that I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie forgetfull and much wanting to my selfe, in that I make no other excuse nor Apologie touching this edition: yet I hope I shall not need to intreate further hereof by the grace of God, to the which I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily commend thee.</p>
