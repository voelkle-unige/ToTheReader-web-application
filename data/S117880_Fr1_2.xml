   <head>TO THE Most excellent, mightie, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Princesse, ELIZABETH, by the grace of God QVEENE of England, France, and Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, defender of the true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith, &amp;c.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F almightie God (most gratious souereigne Ladie) had but as meanlie furnished mee with vnderstanding and vtterance, as hee hath plentifullie inriched your Maiestie with manie most excellent gifts and graces, my penne at this time would runne more agreeable to your Highnesse eares, and my words pearse more deepe into your Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie breast. Then might I, though with some boldnesse, yet with all humblenesse, approch your presence, and present you with such matter, as God by his holie spirit hath offered mee: and in such maner as might be most liking to your godlie disposition. Not that J poore simple man can prefer aught as yet vnknowne to your excellent Maiestie, to whom God in his sonne Christ hath imparred as great abundance of his wisedome and knowledge, as flesh &amp; bloud in this life can well conceiue, but that J haue of long time beene carried with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie zeale and desire incomparable once in my life, by some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall record of your roial name, to giue an outward testimonie of mine inward hart, and an assured seale of my bounden dutie, so long borne to your manifold vertues, religious profession, and high estate. And for the better performance of this my determined purpose, perceiuing my selfe, though not vnwilling, yet vnable to publish anie worke wholie of <pb facs="3"/> mine owne deuise, woorthie the regard of so great a Prince, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of so iudiciall a censure, J resolued at last vpon this booke: a worke, not so long, as learned; conteining matter, not so hard, as true: written by an Author, not so late, as famous, which J haue faithfullie translated, and partlie gathered, and wholie dedicated to your excellent Maiestie. For as all scripture inspired from aboue, is profitable to teach, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue, to correct, and to instruct in righteousnesse, that the man of God may be wise vnto saluation, and perfect vnto all good works: so in this worke is drawne a perfect forme of the most ancient religion, &amp; true ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God set downe by the Apostles. Jn it is reprooued the huge heape of heresies and errours sproong vp in the church, since the incarnation of Christ, with the particular discouerie of the <hi>Romane</hi> Antichristian kingdome: Jn it is comprised a due correction of sundrie defaults in life, and defects in gouernement: Jn it is deliuered a perfect instruction for soundnesse of conscience and sinceritie of conuersation to all estates: besides manie speciall comforts to the troubled, exhortations to the slowe, persuasions to the doubtfull, incouragements to the forward, reprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the obstinate, explications of hard scriptures, distinctions of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult saiengs, discoueries of false arguments, and definitions of diffuse questions. And as for the Authour in a word or two: neuer was there yet found anie aduersarie so enuious, as to denie his learning; nor so sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till, as to refell his arguments; nor so wise, as to ouer-reach his discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor so terrible, as to driue him from his godlie purpose; no nor so malicious, as to slander his life: wherein he bestowed his time, and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued himselfe not onelie as a right Euangelist, but (if it be lawfull so to saie) as a verie Apostle. Wherefore, I most humblie beseech your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, that according to your accustomed gratious fauour, it will please you to be partaker of these fruits of his, and protector of these labours of mine, sowne and sproong vp, ripened and gathered, begun and ended within the walles of your Highnesse Court, by your most faithfull and loiall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect and seruant.</p>
   <p>But now in making mention of this matter, J cannot but call to mind with ioie and reuerence, that this our natiue countrie did first of all king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms in the world, faithfullie receiue, and publikelie professe the religion of Christ. And it reioiseth me much more, that after so long and so foule <pb facs="3"/> a fall of the house of God, this of all other kingdoms did first openlie inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to repaire the ruines thereof: a principall labourer in which worke was <hi>D. Peter Martyr,</hi> who long susteined vpon his owne, and almost onlie shoulders the greatest weight of this burthen: but most of all doo I praise the Lord euen from my hart, that after satan our ancient enimie had giuen a sharp assault vpon Gods saints, who began to laie both their heds &amp; their hands to the new building of this temple, the Lord, by your Maiestie, though weake in respect of your sex, yet strong by his power (who chooseth the weake things of this world to confound the strong, that his power might appeere in our infirmitie) repelled his violence, defeated his practises, withstood his force, ouerthrew his complices, and proceeded to the reedification of his church. O that blessed daie, wherein your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie was placed in your roiall seate, to restore the decaied church, so long captiuated vnder cruell
<hi>Pharao</hi> and idolatrous <hi>Nabuchad-nezar!</hi> wherein the bloud of so manie thousand seruants of God was saued from the vile hands of Antichristian tormentors: wherin the desperate estate of poore seelie afflicted banished soules was recouered and restored by a mightie hand and stretched-out arme, from <hi>Babylon,</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> from
<hi>Dan</hi> &amp; <hi>Bethel,</hi> to the holie hill of <hi>Sion;</hi> from superstition, to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; from idolatrie, to true worship; from the heathenish masse, to a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Communion; from papisticall rites, to apostolicall ceremonies; from beads to praiers; from legends to sermons; from bondage to libertie: and euen as it were from hell to heauen. O that all Christian English harts would celebrate that happie daie with all ioifull solemnitie, with all prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to God, and praiers for you, who reduced vs in triumph, your selfe as principall captiue leading the danse before the arke of the Lord! Jt was your Maiestie that reuiued those good and godlie decrees, which your most renowmed father and gratious brother had made for the repairing of the Lords tabernacle. You sent laborers vnto the building, you prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed them perfect rules, whereby to square euerie stone and peece of tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber according to the paterne that the Lord shewed
<hi>Moses</hi> in the mount: You commanded them to raise their building vpon the foundations of the prophets and apostles, Jesu Christ being the head corner stone. But ô la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable case to be sorrowed of all such, as seeke saluation in Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and sigh with vnspeakable grones to see the perfect finishing and <pb facs="4"/> furnishing of the holie temple. The enimie hath sowed tares among the good seed,
<hi>Reum</hi> and <hi>Samsai</hi> with their adherents haue bended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues against the children of God. The sonne of perdition exalting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the temple of God, aboue all that is called God, hath spred diuers nets, laid many snares, digged deepe pits, vsed sundrie, some bloudie, some craftie meanes to hinder the worke, and to destroie the workmen: now by out-criengs &amp; horrible rorings of the Romish bull: now by attempting forreine power, to depose your Highnesse from your state, and discharge your loiall subiects of their allegeance: now by assaieng how he could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile by more than ciuill sword: now by raising sundrie dangerous and damnable sects and sectaries to diminish the credit, and hinder the good successe of the Gospell: now by sophisticall writing and printing against the receiued truth, mightilie confirmed by the inuincible word of God: and lastlie by conueieng in that secret seminarie of sedition, which close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and craftilie entering into this realme, vnder pretense of long praiers, deuoure widowes houses, lead captiue simple women, and other sillie se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced soules; trauell by land and sea to make proselytes double woorse the children of hell than they themselues: and so rob your Maiestie of your subiects, God of his creatures, Christ of his members, the people of their saluation: and vnder a colourable cloke of defending themselues, and bewailing their owne estate, in their pharisaicall libels, ouer-boldlie dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to your Maiestie, and the Lords of your Honourable priuie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, doo traiterouslie insinuate &amp; vniustlie accuse you and your most mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate lawes and statutes of intollerable rigour and crueltie. But such as their doctrine is wicked and worldlie, such are their words false and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Howbeit, all these their pestilent deuises and designements not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, as your Maiestie hath begun most godlie, and most mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellouslie proceeded, so go you forward most happilie from faith to faith, from strength to strength, and from glorie to glorie, vntill Christ shall tread downe his and your enimies vnder his feet and yours. Arme your selfe, most mightie Princesse, with the principall spirit of fortitude, strengthen your hart with the certeintie of the truth, repose your faith on the onelie written word, cast your hope and care vpon the prouidence diuine. So shall you neuer need to feare, neither the maine forces of your professed enimies, nor the dissembled practises of your pretensed freends. <pb facs="4"/> For so renowmed is your name and honour among all godlie Princes, as no enuie can diminish your glorie; so trulie doo your people loue you, as no secret treason can be hid from your person; so wise and circumspect is your Councell, as no forreine practises can preuaile against you; so strong is your Kingdome, so well furnished your munition, so terrible your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, and so stedfast your fortune. Againe, so valiant are your subiects, so manie in number, so frequented with victories, so readie to your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense, so assured to their countrie, and so zealous in religion: On the other side, so godlie are your owne purposes, so miraculous your proceedings, so peaceable your desires, so bountifull your benefits, and so cleare your owne conscience; so cleare, J saie, speciallie from the bloud of all men, as there remaineth no more in this worke of yours, but that you vtterlie shake off all feare, and put your trust in the Lord of hosts, and so finish this glorious building. Which being performed, blesse you with <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> all the church of Jsrael, and with all your people giue thanks vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God the father in his deere sonne, bicause he hath dealt mercifullie with you, and made you more gratious and honourable in his sight, than anie King and Prince of the earth. And now, as your Maiestie for your owne part, by the speciall assisting grace of God, hath beene hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, and is at this daie, and shall by Gods grace for euer be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie setled and grounded on the right side, of all questions now in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie betweene vs and our aduersaries; so to the end that your people may continuallie vnderstand how they haue beene carried awaie by false teachers from the sinceritie and singlenesse of the Gospell published by the Apostles, and established in this your realme, vnto a multitude of erronious opinions and mans inuentions: and that no faithfull subiect hereafter may iustlie complaine of ignorance, or pretend a readinesse to followe the truth, if it were rightlie taught, and easie to be found; your Maiestie of your godlie zeale, hath vouchsafed to suffer the works of manie learned and true professors to haue free course in all your domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to all good and godlie effects and purposes. Wherein you haue not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie performed all the good parts of a gratious Christian Queene; but haue thereby saued infinite soules, which otherwise without the benefit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of had liued still in blindnesse, and died in danger of euerlasting damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Wherefore, seeing this booke of <hi>D. Peter Martyrs</hi> Common pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <pb facs="5"/> among and aboue all other bookes written of like argument will most fullie and sufficientlie satisfie all those that read the same with a single eie, and bring not with them consciences vnsensible, seared vp with an hot iron: and seeing all the doctrine herein comprehended, is agreeable to the word of eternall life, and conformable to the religion restored in this your Realme, J am eftsoones most humblie to desire your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, that the same may obteine free passage throughout your Kingdome. Whereby your Maiestie, besides all other benefits, for the which I stand most deepelie bounden vnto your Highnesse, shall heape vpon me a grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fauour, by vouchsafing my labours so great a credit: vpon the Author himselfe, by giuing him so famous a testimonie: vpon your naturall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, by granting them so singular a commoditie: yea &amp; vpon your selfe, by witnessing to all posteritie and succeding ages, how highlie you esteeme the learning and vertue of so excellent a man. Finallie, you shall doo that, which will redound to the glorie of almightie God, to the credit of the time, the increase of the church, the furtherance of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, the extirpation of error, the aduancement of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and to the vtter ouerthrowe of all vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse togither with Antichrist and all his adherents.</p>
