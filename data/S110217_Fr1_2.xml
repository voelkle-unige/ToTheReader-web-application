   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, SIR THOMAS EGERTON KNIGHT, BARON OF Ellesmere, Lord high Chancellor of England, and <hi>one of his Maiesties most honorable priuie Counsell,</hi> I. D. wisheth all grace and prosperitie in this <hi>life, and eternall happinesse in the life to come.</hi>

   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I considered (Right Honorable) the great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>issance, and preuailing strength, of these arch-enemies of our saluation, <hi>the world, and worldly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,</hi> manifested in their daily conquests, not onely of those, who voluntarily yeeld at the first onset, and are willingly content to become their vassals and slaues, for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine tenure, and base wages of earthly vanities; but also of such as hauing giuen their names to Christ, by receiuing his sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, professed themselues to be his souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb facs="3"/> and seruants, and that amongst other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, they would valiantly fight his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes, against the world, and worldly lusts: who notwithstanding their oath and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, either yeeld subiection to the world vpon the offer of earthly profits, pleasures, and preferments, or stand in a cold neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, desiring to doe seruice to the world and God too; but without all indifferencie, seeing he hath onely the seruice of their lips, and some outward deuotions, meerely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementall, and ceremoniall; whereas the other master hath the seruice of their hearts, and all their care, labours, and painefull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours imploied about him. And when as I saw the glorious trophees of the worlds victories erected, not onely in euery corner of the common-wealth, but euen in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and church of God, to his great disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the disgrace of his true religion; I thought I could not spend my strength in a better quarrell, then in opposing against this enemie of our saluation; to the end, that I might abate his preuailing forces, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the very sinewes of his strength, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee most glorieth and triumpheth; by
<pb facs="3"/> shewing that the wages of iniquitie whereby he inticeth men to leaue Gods standard, and to fight vnder his colours, is but base and counterfeite coine, being examined by the touchstone of Gods truth, and therefore not to be receiued of a Christian for good pay; much lesse to be preferred before that crowne of victorie, euerlasting glorie, and those all-sufficient treasures of our heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kingdome, which God promiseth to all those who fight his battailes, and valiantly ouercome. Neither did I thinke that I could more profitably spend my studies in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther argument, especiallie in these times, wherein the loue of the world so greatly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth, that with <hi>Demas</hi> men daily fall from the profession of Gods truth, and imbrace the world, hauing onely so much loue of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as the loue of the world worketh in them; and either not seruing God at all, or only that they may serue their owne turnes, in worldly and carnall respects. For if by plaine testimonies of holy Scriptures, and by effectuall reasons (as it were a proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion sent from the great king of heauen and earth) I could crie downe the high rates and
<pb facs="4"/> prices of these base and copper coynes, and bring them to their owne value; by shewing that there is no excellencie &amp; true worth in them, but onely as they serue for the present necessitie of our earthly state, and to furnish vs in our trauaile towards our heauenly countrie; then would there many and great benefits bee hereby deriued vnto vs. For if we could contemne the world and worldly vanities, as things of small worth, then would they not be as heauie clogs to hinder vs from running the Christian race, and from ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in our meditations into Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to take possession for the present of our heauenly inheritance with our mindes and thoughts, till our soules and bodies doe come thither: then would we not suffer them to take vp all our cogitations, care, studie, and labour, about the getting or preseruing them, so as wee haue little or no time left to performe seruice vnto God; or if at all wee doe it, yet with much distraction and pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation: then would the tentations of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell haue no power to draw vs into sinne, wanting this wages of iniquitie, and these al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring baites, wherewith hee inticeth vs to
<pb facs="4"/> come into his nets of perdition: for who would serue satan for nought, or for such things as he contemneth, or but lightly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lueth, leauing the seruice of his Creator and Redeemer, and thereby hazarding the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall losse of those heauenly excellencies which he hath promised vnto his seruants in the life to come? Then should wee haue a true golden age, free from all oppression, bribing, extortion, fraude, wrongs, dissensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, treasons, rebellions, and innumerable other outrages, which are caused and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned through the immoderate loue of these earthly things; and perfect loue and charitie being entertained amongst men, they would striue who should exceed other in al good and Christian duties, louing ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and goodnes for their owne sakes: then would not those who abound with these worldly things be euer the prouder, or with scornefull insolence ouerlooke their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; for who is proud of that which hee contemneth? Neither would those that want them be much troubled, hauing for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Gods better gifts, euen his sanctifying and sauing graces, and for the time to come
<pb facs="5"/> farre more excellent hopes, life eternall, and the vnspeakeable ioies of Gods glorious kingdome. For who bewaileth the want, or lamenteth the losse of those things which he lightly esteemeth, especially hauing both in possession and hope, such things as are of farre greater worth and excellencie? Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if wee were perswaded to contemne the world and worldly vanities, and highly to esteeme of the ioyes of Heauen, then would we not feare the approach of death, but bid it welcome with a cheerefull countenance? seeing it taketh vs from the things which we doe not much regard, and entreth vs into the possession and fruition of our better hopes; euen a kingdome matchles, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie endlesse. Whereas contrariwise, when these worldly things bee ouerualued, and too much loued and desired, they wholly take vp mens meditations, and disable them for Gods seruice, they lay them open to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans tentations, and make them readie to perpetrate and commit any wickednesse, which may further them to the obtaining of the things which they affect; neither is there any stop in the way to hinder their headlong
<pb facs="5"/> course in sin, vnlesse it be when their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desires do crosse one another: they puffe men vp with pride when they inioy them, and consume them with griefe and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent when they want them: and to conclude, they make death most terrible, because it plucketh thē violently from these delights, vnto which their hearts are fast glued, and forceth them to leaue the things which they dearely loue, hauing no assurance or hope of a better life. For the auoiding of all which euils, and for the furthering and aduancing of the former benefits, I haue laboured in this argument, euen aboue my strength, God shewing his power in my weakenes, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing my desire to supplie that which was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in my health. Of which my labours I haue chosen your Lordship for patron, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to shew my loue and dutie vnto you, from whom I haue had, both al the meanes of my maintenance which I enioy, wherewith I haue been enabled to labour; and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to exercise that poore talent which I haue receiued from my great Lord and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster: and partly because I thought, I could not dedicate vnto you a booke of a fitter ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
<pb facs="6"/> wherein your selfe may at your best leasure meditate; seeing on the one side the greatnes of your place, and height of your honors and preferments may (without your greater vigilance and circumspection) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline your affections too much to the loue of these earthly things, and on the other side your age (vnto which God adde many yeares for his owne glorie, the Churches good, and your owne euerlasting comfort) is not likely in course of nature to allow vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you any long possession of these mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentanie things. In regard of both which, your Honour cannot bee too well armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the immoderate loue of these world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vanities, nor haue your heart too much inflamed with that diuine loue of Heauen, and those most glorious ioyes in Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, which you shall inherit for euermore; because hereby you shall inioy Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings more securely whilest you haue them, when as your heart is not so fixed on them but that you can bee content to leaue them; and part with them also with ioy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, when as you are assured, that you shall exchange them for those heauenly ioyes,
<pb facs="6"/> and rich treasures of Gods glorious king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which infinitely exceede all earthly preferments in worth and excellency. Which if my poore labours, added to your better helps, and holy meditations, might any way further, I should much more reioice in being a poore instrument of your spirituall good, then in the inioying of those earthly benefits which I haue receiued from you. The Lord more and more inrich your noble heart with all spirituall and sauing grace, and after a long and happie life on earth, vouchsafe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you the euerlasting fruition of his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous presence, and that fulnesse of ioy which is at his right hand for euermore. Amen.</p>
