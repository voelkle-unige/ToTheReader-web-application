   <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE
Sir WILLIAM RVSSELL, Lord Russell,

Grace and Peace.</head>
   <p>
      <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>IGHT Honorable,<note place="margin">Mat. 3.</note> as Iohn the Baptist was in one desert, so our
Sauiour Christ he was in an other:<note place="margin">Mat. 4. 1.</note> but as these two differed in their
being in the world: so did they not accord in their being in the
wildernesse. Iohn was with some men, Christ with none; Iohn was
with wilde men, Christ with wild beasts; Iohn was preaching, Christ
praying; Iohn was baptizing, Christ fighting; Iohn was feeding,
Christ fasting; Iohn was encountring with Diuels incarnate, Christ
did encounter with the Prince of those Diuels. From Iohn prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
in the desert, learne wee diligence in our callings: from
Christ tempted in the desert, see we troubles at our calling:<note n="a" place="margin">Psa. 34. 19.</note> Many are the troubles of the
righteous, but the Lord deliuereth them out of all.</p>
   <p>If it please you to giue these after-lines the reading, you shall see set downe that monomachie
or single combat, which was hand to hand betwixt Christ and the Diuell. And as for Christ
Iesus, you shall see him fasting, fighting, conquering. Fasting and an hungry, to shew he was
man: fighting and encountring, to shew he was Messiah; and conquering and triumphing, to
shew he was God. And as for the diuell, you shall see him obiecting, answering, flying. Obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting,
that<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 4. 3.</note> Christ might despaire;<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 4. 6.</note> answering, that he might presume; and<note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 4. 11.</note> flying, when he
could not ouercome.</p>
   <p>In Christs temptations, we see the estate of the<note n="e" place="margin">1. Pe. 2. 21.</note> Church; in Satans assault, we see his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
to the<note n="f" place="margin">1. Pet. 5. 8.</note> Church, Is Christ tempted? think it not strange if we fall into<note n="g" place="margin">Ioh. 15. 20</note> temptations. For
the griefe of the head, is the griefe of the<note n="h" place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 26.</note> members: and the temptations of Christ, shew the
temptations of<note n="i" place="margin">Ioh. 15. 20.</note> Christians. It is true of Christ, that<note n="k" place="margin">Act. 14. 21</note> by many tribulations he did enter into
the kingdome of God: that<note n="l" place="margin">Heb. 2. 10</note> our High Priest was consecrated by afflictions, that so he must suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
and enter into his<note n="m" place="margin">Luk. 24. 26</note> glory.</p>
   <p>He is no sooner borne into the world, but he is<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 2. 14.</note> hunted by Herod; baptized at Iordan,<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 3. 16. 4. 1.</note> but
Satan sets on him; a Preacher for repentance, but the<note n="c" place="margin">Ioh. 7. 1.</note> Scribes proscribe him; to<note n="d" place="margin">Luk. 11. 15.</note> worke mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
but the Pharises slander him. He is no sooner to suffer, but<note n="e" place="margin">Ioh. 12. 27.</note> the Diuell assaults him;
apprehended, but the<note n="f" place="margin">Ioh. 18. 28</note> Iewes deliuer him; deliuered, but<note n="g" place="margin">Luk. 23. 11.</note> Herod derides him; derided, but
<note n="h" place="margin">Luk. 23. 24.</note>Pilat condemnes him; condemned, but the souldiers<note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 27. 27.</note> abuse him. Is he on the crosse? the
<note n="k" place="margin">Mat. 27. 39.</note>people will not pity him: is he risen? the high Priests will<note n="l" place="margin">Mat. 28. 15.</note> belie him. In a word, is he vpon
earth? he is tempted in his<note n="m" place="margin">Luk. 11. 16.</note> person; is he in heauen? he is<note n="n" place="margin">Act. 9. 4.</note> tempted in his members. Thus
the life of Christ was a warfare vpon earth, and the life of Christians must be a warfare vpon
earth. We liue heere in a sea of troubles: the sea is the world, the waues are calamities, the
Church is the ship, the anker is hope, the sailes are loue, the Saints are passengers, the hauen
is heauen, and Christ is our Pilot. When the sea can continue without waues, the shippe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
tossings, and passengers not be sicke vpon the water, then shall the Church of God be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
trials. We begin this voiage so soone as we are borne, and we must saile on till our dying
daie.</p>
   <p>We doe reade in Gods word of many kinds of temptations: <hi>God, Satan, Man,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi>
and the <hi>Flesh,</hi> are saide to tempt. <hi>God</hi> tempteth man to trie his obedience, <hi>Satan</hi> tempteth
man to make him disobedient: <hi>man</hi> doe tempt men to trie what is in them: and <hi>man</hi> tempteth
God to trie what is in him. The <hi>world</hi> is a temper, to keepe man from God: and the <hi>flesh</hi> is a
<pb facs="5"/>
tempter, to bring man to the Diuell: So <hi>God</hi> tempted Abraham<note n="a" place="margin">Gen 22. 1.</note> in the offering of his son:
<hi>Satan</hi>
      <note n="b" place="margin">Iob. 1. 18.</note> tempted Iob in the losse of his goods: a<note n="c" place="margin">1. Kng. 10. 1.</note>
      <hi>Queene</hi> tempted Salomon in trying his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
<hi>men</hi>
      <note n="d" place="margin">Ex. 17. 3.</note> tempted God by distrust in the desert: the <hi>world</hi> tempted Domas,<note n="e" place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 10.</note> when he
forsooke the Apostles: and the <hi>flesh</hi> tempted Dauid,<note n="f" place="margin">2. Sa. 11. 4.</note> when he fell by adultery. Doth God
tempt vs? take heed of hypocrisie: doth Satan tempt vs? take heed of his subtiltie: doth man
tempt man? take heed of dissembling: doth man tempt God? take heed of inquiring: doth the
world tempt man? take heed of apostasie: doth the flesh tempt man? take heed of carnalitie.
But dowe so? are we warie of these tempers? No, we are not, and therefore we fall. We fall
on the right hand, by temptations in prosperitie, and we fall on the left, by temptations in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie.
Of the one it may be said, it hath slaine<note n="g" place="margin">1. Sa. 18.</note> thousands: of the other, that it hath slaine
ten thousands.</p>
   <p>When we come and see cities dispeopled, houses defaced, and wals pulled downe, we say, the
souldier hath beene there: and when we see pride in the rich, discontent in the poore, and sinne
in all, we may iustly say, the Tempter hath beene there.</p>
   <p>Now of all other temptations, it pleaseth God to suffer his church to be tempted with afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
It is neuer free either from the sword of Ishmael; which is<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 21. 9.</note> a reuiling tongue: or the
sword of Esau, a<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 27. 41.</note> persecuting hand. Neither was there yet euer Christian man found, who had
not his part in the cup of affliction. We must drinke of the<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 20. 23.</note> same cup our master did:<note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 10. 24.</note> the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciple
is not aboue his master.</p>
   <p>The reasons why God doth visit vs thus with afflictions, are: 1. To humble vs. 2. To weane
vs. 3. To winnow vs. 4. To preuent vs. 5.<note place="margin">Reasons why God doth afflict his children.</note> To teach vs. 6. To enlighten vs. 7. To honour vs. 8.
To cure vs. 9. To crowne vs. 10. To comfort vs. 11. To protect vs. 12. To adopt vs. And last
of all, to teach and comfort others. To<note n="e" place="margin">Ec. 3. 10.</note> humble vs, that we be not proud:<note n="f" place="margin">Psal. 119. 67.</note> to weane vs, that
we loue not his world:<note n="g" place="margin">Luk. 22. 31.</note> to winnow vs, that we be not chaffe:<note n="h" place="margin">Psal. 119. 71.</note> to preuent vs, that we do not
sinne:<note n="i" place="margin">Psal. 39 9 40. 1.</note> to teach vs, that we be patient in aduersity: to<note n="k" place="margin">Ge. 42. 21.</note> enlighten vs, that we see our errors: to
<note n="l" place="margin">Lam. 5. 11.</note>honor vs, that our faith may be manifest: to cure vs, that we<note n="m" place="margin">Deu. 32. 15.</note> surfet not of securitie: to
<note n="n" place="margin">2. Tim. 4. 7.</note>crowne vs, that we may liue eternally: to<note n="o" place="margin">Ioh. 6. 33.</note> comfort vs, that he may send his spirit: to<note n="p" place="margin">Act. 12. 7.</note> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
vs, that he may guide vs by his Angels: to<note n="a" place="margin">He. 12. 7.</note> adopt vs, that we may be his sonnes:<note n="b" place="margin">2. Pet. 2. 5.</note> and
to teach others, that they seeing how sin is punished in vs, they may take heed it be not found in
them: that they<note n="c" place="margin">2. Cor. 1. 6.</note> seeing our comforts in troubles, may not be discouraged in the like trials.</p>
   <p>Thus a Christian mans diet is more sowre then sweet: his physicke is more alcës then hony:
his life is more a pilgrimage then a progresse: and his death is more despised then honoured.
This if men would thinke of before, afflictions would be as welcome to the soule of man, as<note n="d" place="margin">Ruth. 2. 8.</note> affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Ruth was to the field of Boaz. But because we looke not for them before they come, thinke
not on Gods doing when they are come, and doe desire to be happie both heere and hereafter;
therefore we can away with the name of Naomi, but in no case would we be called<note n="e" place="margin">Ruth. 1. 20.</note> Mara.
We<note n="f" place="margin">Ioh. 1. 5.</note> see the sea, not the whale: the<note n="g" place="margin">Exod. 14. 11.</note> Egyptian, not the saluation: the<note n="h" place="margin">Dan. 6. 16. 22.</note> Lious mouth, not
him that stoppeth the Lions mouth. If we could see God in our troubles, as<note n="i" place="margin">2. King. 6. 16.</note> Elisha did in his,
then would we say: There are more with vs, then there are against vs. But because we doe
not, therefore at euery assault of the Assyrians, we say, as the seruant to<note n="k" place="margin">2 King. 6. 15.</note> Elishah did: Alas
master, what shall we doe? and with the disciples: Carest thou not Master that we perish? Yet
it is good for vs to suffer affliction:<note n="m" place="margin">Iam. 1. 12. Ioh. 5. 17.</note> Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he
is tried, he shall receiue the crowne of life which the Lord hath promised to them that loue him.
It is<note n="a" place="margin">Pro. 3. 11.</note> commanded by God,<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 4. 2.</note> practised by Christ,<note n="c" place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 12.</note> yeelded to by the Saints,<note n="d" place="margin">Psal. 119. 71.</note> assigned by Gods
prouidence, and good for vs ech way. We are Gods<note n="e" place="margin">Ps. l. 1. 4.</note> trees, we shall groe better by pruning: Gods
pomander, smell better by rubbing: Gods spice, he more profitable by bruising: and Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits,
we are the better by running. Let vs suffer afflictions, they are<note n="f" place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 17.</note> momentany in respect of
time:<note n="g" place="margin">Phil. 1. 29.</note> fauors, if we respect Gods loue, and a meanes to bring vs to the kingdome of God. If
they did consume vs, we might wish them an end: but they doe purge vs, let vs be content. They
<note n="h" place="margin">Act. 14. 21.</note>are Gods fan, we are Gods wheat: they are Gods boulter, we are Gods meale: they are Gods
<note n="i" place="margin">Pet. 1. 5.</note>flame, we are Gods bush: they are Gods<note n="k" place="margin">Ge. 22. 9.</note> cords, we are Gods sacrifice: they are Gods fornace,
we are Gods gold. The wheat will not be good without the fan, nor the meale without the boulter,
nor the bush without the flame, nor the sacrifice without the cords, nor the gold without the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace:
they are trials, not punishments, if we be sonnes: punishments, not trials, if we be slaues.
<pb facs="5"/>
Let vs then beare them, they<note n="l" place="margin">Psal. 37. 37.</note> will haue an end: ioy<note n="m" place="margin">Ps. 126. 5.</note> will follow: they<note n="n" place="margin">Isa. 38. 10.</note> shew vs our weekenesse:
they<note n="o" place="margin">Hos. 5. 15.</note> moue vs to pray: they<note n="p" place="margin">Luke. 24. 26.</note> shew we are in the path way to heauen: and<note n="q" place="margin">Ecc. 1. 2.</note> make vs contemne
this present world. By them we<note n="a" place="margin">2. Sam. 24. 17.</note> learne to repent vs of sinne past,<note n="b" place="margin">Ge. 39. 9.</note> to take heed of sinne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and to foresee sinne to come. By them we<note n="c" place="margin">Act. 2. 2.</note> receiue Gods spirit:<note n="d" place="margin">Phi. 3. 10.</note> are like to Christ: are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted

Dauids troubles, and feresee what may be our troubles. The more righteous we are,
the more manifold are our troubles: and he better we are, the better we may indure them.</p>
   <p>But as our troubles are many, so are our deliuerances many God will deliuer vs out of all. He
that deliuered<note n="p" place="margin">Gen. 7.</note> Noah from the floud,<note n="q" place="margin">Gen. 19.</note> Lot from Sodome,<note n="r" place="margin">Gen. 33.</note> Iacob from Esau,<note n="s" place="margin">Gen. 41. 14.</note> Ioseph from

<note n="l" place="margin">Act. 5.</note>from the Iewes,<note n="m" place="margin">Mat. 4.</note> and Christ from the Diuell: he, euen he will either deliuer vs from trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or comfort vs in trouble, or mitigate troubles when they come vpon vs.</p>
   <p>He,<note n="n" place="margin">Ro. 4. 21.</note> he hath promised to doe it, and he that hath promised, is able to do it. And this he
doth sometimes by no meanes, sometimes by small meanes, sometimes by ordinary meanes, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by extraordinarie, sometimes contrarie to all meanes. By no<note n="o" place="margin">Ioh. 5. 9.</note> meanes be cured a creeple
at Bethesda: by<note n="p" place="margin">Ioh. 6. 12.</note> small meanes he fed fiue thousand in the desert: by<note n="q" place="margin">Mat. 4. 7.</note> ordinary meanes he was

contrarie to all meanes were the<note place="margin">Dan. 5.</note> three children preserued in the fornace of fire.</p>
   <p>I haue good cause to thinke of Gods gracious deliuerance, being my selfe deliuered from a
great trouble. Since the time I was vnkindly dismissed from my poore charge, where I would
haue continued, if malice had not hindred me, I haue liued in an end of this City: dangerously
in respect of the sicknesse; poorely in regard of maintenance; and painfully, in respect of my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie:
yet till this time hath the Lord deliuered me: and as Paul said,<note n="a" place="margin">2. Tim. 1. 18.</note> he will deliuer me, if
that he see it be best for me.</p>
   <p>Let man therefore<note n="b" place="margin">1. Sam. 309.</note> comfort himselfe in the Lord:<note n="c" place="margin">Hos. 6. 2.</note> after two daies he will reuiue vs, and
the third day he will raise vs vp againe:<note n="d" place="margin">Psal. 30. 5.</note> Heauiensse may endure for a night, but ioy will come
in the morning.<note n="e" place="margin">Psal. 58. 11.</note> Doubtlesse there is a reward for the righteous: verily,<note n="f" place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
            <desc>•</desc>
         </gap>ca. 7. 8.</note> God retaineth not his
wrath for euer. Could he ouercome the world, and can he not ouercome many troubles in the
world? Yea, let one plague follow another, as one quaile sings to another: yet as the<note n="g" place="margin">Act. 28. 3.</note> viper lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
on Paules hand, and forthwith leaped off againe, so one trouble shall leape vpon the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and anon leap off againe:<note n="h" place="margin">Ps. 37. 24.</note> though he fall, he shall rise againe, the righteous shall not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
for euer.</p>
   <p>if he hath deliuered vs from the guilt of our sinnes, he will deliuer vs from the punishment of
our sinnes. Let vs then therefore be patient in trouble, constant in hope, rooted in loue: let vs
waite and he will come, call and he will heare, beleeue and he will performe, repent vs of our euill
committed against him, and he will repent of his euils intended against vs. He is ouer vs by his

of his frinds:<note n="d" place="margin">Iob. 16. 2.</note> Silly comforters are you all. They will leaue vs, as mice doe a ruinous house▪ but
the Lord (like<note n="e" place="margin">Ruth. 1. 16.</note> Ruthe to Naomi) will neuer leaue vs, nor forsake vs, Especially in the houre
of death,<note n="f" place="margin">Ecc. 41. 1.</note> which is in remembrance bitter to great men: in that houre of death he will be with

he awakes as a man out of sleepe, and as a Giant refreshed with wine. He will rebuke

owne labours, but also other mens to great personages, especially such Workes wherein they
haue beene either Translators or ouerseers. It were infinit to instance this point. I am bolde
to doe the like to your Honour at this time. This Copie it was brought vnto my hand, I haue
conferred it with another, I haue persued it at the Presse, I heard diuers of the Sermons, I
haue added nothing of mine owne: and I desire, that of those<note n="a" place="margin">Ioh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
